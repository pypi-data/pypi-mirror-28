NLP on rap lyrics.

In rap, comparison is huge. Many rappers compare themselves to the greats: Pac, Em, Jay, Nas, Biggie and many, many more. With this project I hope to bring those comparisons to life. 

I'd like to be able to compare lyrics, emotions, track the emotional life of a rapperâ€”that is, were they more angry when they were younger compared to their records they release when they're 35+? These are the questions I'd like to answer with this project.

Some other questions:

1) How do topics differ when the context is freestyle vs written?

2) Rap beefs! Not even sure what questions to ask just yet, but rap beefs in and of themselves are worth exploring.

3) Which rappers rap most about cars, money, girls? Which rappers rap about other topics?

4) Take the 10 biggest rappers from the 90s, the 200xs, and the 20x0s and see how the topics differ. Is rap getting deeper? More varied topically?

These are some of the questions that cypher will try to answer.
