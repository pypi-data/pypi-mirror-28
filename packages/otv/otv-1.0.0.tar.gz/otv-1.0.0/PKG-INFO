Description: Ortho4XP Tile Validator
        =======================
        
        Have you:
        
        -  Built dozens if not hundreds of Ortho4XP tiles, but now get
           mysterious crashes when scenery tries to load?
        -  Had your Ortho4XP process crash during the night and don't know which
           tiles completed successfully?
        
        I have. So I wrote a utility to scan through all the Ortho4XP tiles and
        validate them, reporting any tiles that have errors so I can fix them in
        Ortho4XP.
        
        Installation
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        If you already have Python(v3) installed and working, you can use
        ``pip3`` to install:
        
        ::
        
            $ pip3 install otv
        
        Otherwise, head over to `GitHub <https://github.com/dyoung522/otv>`__ or
        `PyPi <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/otv>`__ and download the latest
        release.
        
        Getting Started
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        There are three ways to run the program:
        
        1. If you installed via the ``pip3`` installer, you'll have an
           executable named **otv** available, so you should be able to:
        
           1. cd into your Ortho4XP directory
           2. run ``otv``
        
        2. Download the latest release from
           `PyPi <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/otv>`__ or
           `GitHub <https://github.com/dyoung522/otv>`__ and extract it into a
           folder. From the command line, run:
        
           ::
        
               python3 bin/otv YourOrtho4XPdir
        
           *(Obviously; change "YourOrtho4XPdir" to wherever you've stored your
           Ortho Tiles)*
        
        3. If you're on windows, and prefer an EXE, download the latest release
           from `GitHub <https://github.com/dyoung522/otv>`__ or
           `PyPi <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/otv>`__, then:
        
           1. Extract the package (anywhere on your filesystem)
           2. Create a shortcut from ``bin/otv.exe`` on your desktop (*must* be
              a shortcut).
           3. Go to the *Properties* of the **shortcut** and change the "Start
              In" field to point to your Ortho4XP directory.
        
           Then you can simply double click the shortcut to run the utility
           anytime.
        
        More Info
        ~~~~~~~~~
        
        -  Running otv without any additional arguments will give you a help
           message:
        
           ::
        
               usage: Ortho4XP Tile Validator [-q | -v] [-p | --no-pause] [--no-progress]
                                              [-h] [--version]
                                              [tile_directory]
        
               Scan all Ortho4XP Tiles and report any problems
        
               positional arguments:
                 tile_directory     Directory where Tiles are stored (usually your Ortho4XP
                                    dir) - If not provided; will use the current directory
        
               display output:
                 -q, --quiet        Suppresses all output; exit value indicates errors found
                 -v, -V, --verbose  Increase verbosity (repeat to increase verbosity more)
        
               alter defaults:
                 -p, -P, --pause    Pause the program before exiting (default for Windows)
                 --no-pause         Disable auto-pause
                 --no-progress      Disables the progress bar display
        
               help and information:
                 -h, --help         show this help message and exit
                 --version          show program's version number and exit
        
        -  Currently, it checks for things like:
        
           -  missing or empty data directories (Earth Nav Data, Terrain,
              Textures)
           -  missing references to textures from each terrain file
           -  textures which exist but aren't referenced from a terrain
        
        -  You can find the pip page on
           `PyPi <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/otv>`__ and the source code on
           `GitHub <https://github.com/dyoung522/otv>`__ (both provide package
           downloads)
        
        OTV is currently in beta, so if you're interested, please try it out and
        let me know how it works for you. I would appreciate any feedback and/or
        bug reports.
        
        Known Issues
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        -  On Windows, the utility will pause after each run, even if running
           from a command line. This is done because most Windows users will be
           running the util from a Shortcut, so the pause is necessary without
           having to specifically add it. You can use the ``--no-pause`` option
           to disable this functionality
