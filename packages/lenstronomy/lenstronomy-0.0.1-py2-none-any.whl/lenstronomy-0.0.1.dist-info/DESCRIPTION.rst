This package is designed to model strong lens systems.
The software is based on Birrer et al 2015, http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ApJ...813..102B and finds application in
e.g. Birrer et al. 2016 for time-delay cosmography and Birrer et al. 2017 for lensing substructure analysis.


The development is coordinated on `GitHub <http://github.com/sibirrer/lenstronomy>`_ and contributions are welcome.
The documentation of **lenstronomy** is available at `readthedocs.org <http://lenstronomy.readthedocs.org/>`_



Installation
--------
* check out the github repository
>>> cd lenstronomy
>>> python setup.py install
or in development mode
>>> python setup.py develop
* it is recommended to check out and install the dependency fastell4py independently.
* run the test functions to see whether the installation was successful.
>>> cd lenstronomy
>>> py.test


Requirements
-------
* to run lens models with elliptical mass distributions, the fastell4py package, originally from Barkana (fastell),
is also required and can be cloned from: githug/sibirrer/fastell4py (needs a fortran compiler)
* CosmoHammer (through PyPi)
* standard python libraries (numpy, scipy)


Bug reporting and contributions
-------
* see CONTRIBUTING.rst
* you can also directly contact the lead developer, Simon Birrer

Modelling Features
--------

* Extended source reconstruction with basis sets (shapelets)
* Analytic light profiles for lens and source as options
* Point sources (including solving the lens equation)
* a variety of mass models to use
* non-linear line-of-sight description
* iterative point spread function
* linear and non-linear optimization modules



Analysis tools
-------
* Standardized fitting procedures for lens modelling
* Modular build up to design plugins by users
* Interactive jupyter notebooks
* Pre-defined plotting and illustration routines
* Particle swarm optimization for parameter fitting
* MCMC (emcee from CosmoHammer) for parameter inferences
* Kinematic modelling
* Cosmographic inference tools




Documentation
-------------

The full documentation can be generated with Sphinx
