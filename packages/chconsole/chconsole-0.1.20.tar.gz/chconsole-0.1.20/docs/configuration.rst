Configuration
=============

The command line option --help-all shows all available configuration options available through the command line.
Additionally the application can be configured through its configuration file. The configuration file can
be generated by::

    chconsole --generate-config

The configuration file is usually generated in the folder .jupyter located in the user's home directory.
(For other possible locations of Jupyter configuration files see the corresponding
`Jupyter documentation <http://jupyter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/system.html#config-dir>`_)
