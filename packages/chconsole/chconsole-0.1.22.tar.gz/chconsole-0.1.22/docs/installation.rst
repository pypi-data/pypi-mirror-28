Installation
============

Requirements
------------

The Chat Console requires Qt, such as
`PyQt5 <http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro>`_,
`PyQt4 <https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download>`_,
or `PySide <http://pyside.github.io/docs/pyside>`_.

**Note:** Make sure that Qt is installed. Unfortunately, Qt cannot be
installed using pip. The next section gives instructions on installing Qt.

Installing Qt (if needed)
-------------------------

We recommend installing PyQt with `conda <http://conda.pydata.org/docs>`_::

    conda install pyqt

or with a system package manager. For Windows, PyQt binary packages may be
used.

Install Chat Console using pip
------------------------------

To install::

    pip install chconsole
