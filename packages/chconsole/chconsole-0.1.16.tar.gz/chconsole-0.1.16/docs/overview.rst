Overview
========

Chat Console is a command console (shell) for Jupyter kernels, including IPython,
with enhancements for inline graphics,
syntax highlighting, and much more.
It facilitates collaborative
work by supporting chat and displaying commands of multiple users asynchronously.

The console can be used by a single user and offers special features when multiple users are connected to
a kernel with multiple consoles. Each input is shown immediately in each users' console.
Furthermore, the users can have shown the names of the users who provided the input.
Additionally, the console can be switched between chat and command input mode. In chat input mode the user
enters chat messages and in command input mode the user enters commands. Compare with the included image.
