Why another serial client?
--------------------------

I couldn't find anything to suit my need. I just wanted to talk to a Raspberry Pi through the serial terminal just as I would do with SSH! I tried many different things, from GNU Screen to bash scripts. But they all were either too clunky, interfered with ``tmux``, or didn't pass ANSI escape codes through. The best thing I found was ``python -m serial.tools.miniterm`` but it had an odd menu system that wasn't needed. Nanocom is a simple modification of ``serial.tools.miniterm``.
