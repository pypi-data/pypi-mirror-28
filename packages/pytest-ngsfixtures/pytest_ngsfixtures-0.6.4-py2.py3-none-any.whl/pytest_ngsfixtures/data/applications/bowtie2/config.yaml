# Conda configuration file for bowtie2
#
# Generated by pytest_ngsfixtures_add_application.py,
# version 0.3.1+59.gfb8c0dd
#
# Application output is output to directories named according to
# version number ({version} format label) and possibly to
# subdirectories named after sequencing configuration, either paired
# end (pe) or single end (pe) ({end} format label)
#
# Applications are run from snakemake with the --use-conda option.
# This will generate a separate conda environment for each version.
# Conda environment files are generated on the fly, listing
# bowtie2 as the sole dependency. In some cases additional
# depencies are required. Add these to the _conda_dependencies parameter
# below.
#
# The snakemake clean rule is defined in ../fileutils.sm. The _clean
# parameter lists additional file patterns targetted for removal.
#
# Finally, some subcommands aren't available for all versions of an
# application. It is possible to override the global _versions by
# adding _versions below the subcommand in question.
#
#
# TODO:
#
# 1. Set default version to the latest version number in case the
# proposed version is wrong
#
# 2. For each rule added to Snakefile, add a corresponding entry below
# with the format of the output file name.
