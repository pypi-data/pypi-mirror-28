        # Mariner
        
        Mariner is a command line torrent searcher. It offers a simple interface for streamlined experience. No more annoying ads and pop-up windows.
        
        It is currently under heavy development, so expect breaking changes. Currently only works in Linux, but any contributions in this regard are welcome.
        
        ## Features
        
        - Search for torrents on Distrowatch, PirateBay and TokyoTosho.
        - Download torrent files and copy magnet links to clipboard.
        - Asynchronous I/O for better responsiveness.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Mariner requires Python 3.5 or newer to run.
        
        **Python package**
        
        Since it is written in pure Python, you can easily install it using pip:
        
        `pip3 install mariner`
        
        **Manual**
        
        Alternatively, to get the latest development version, you can clone this repository and then manually install Mariner:
        
        ```
        git clone git@gitlab.com:radek-sprta/mariner.git
        cd mariner
        python3 setup.py install
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        Mariner supports both interactive and non-interactive modes. To see the list of commands, simply type:
        
        `mariner help`
        
        In order to start Mariner in interactive mode, run it without any arguments:
        
        `mariner`
        
        Then search for Ubuntu torrents:
        
        `(mariner) search Ubuntu`
        
        and download the first result on the list:
        
        `(mariner) download 0`
        
        Alternatively, copy the magnet link to clipboard:
        
        `(mariner) magnet 0`
        
        And quit:
        
        `(mariner) quit`

        ## TODO
        - Add more trackers for searching
        - Allow searching multiple torrent trackers at once
        - Show torrent details
        - Pass torrents directly to Transmission and Deluge
