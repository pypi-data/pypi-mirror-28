        Scripts
        ~~~~~~~
        
        **`NanoPlot <https://github.com/wdecoster/NanoPlot>`__**: creating many
        relevant plots derived from reads (fastq), alignments (bam) and albacore
        summary files. Examples can be found in `the gallery on my
        blog <https://gigabaseorgigabyte.wordpress.com/2017/06/01/example-gallery-of-nanoplot/>`__.
        NanoPack is also available with a graphical user interface in
        **`NanoGUI <https://github.com/wdecoster/nanogui>`__**.
        
        **`NanoComp <https://github.com/wdecoster/nanocomp>`__**: comparing
        multiple runs on read length and quality based on reads (fastq),
        alignments (bam) or albacore summary files.
        
        **`NanoStat <https://github.com/wdecoster/nanostat>`__**: Quickly create
        a statistical summary from reads, an alignment or a summary file.
        
        **`NanoFilt <https://github.com/wdecoster/nanofilt>`__**: Streaming
        script for filtering a fastq file based on a minimum length and minimum
        quality cut-off. Also trimming nucleotides from either read ends is an
        option.
        
        **`NanoLyse <https://github.com/wdecoster/nanolyse>`__**: Streaming
        script for filtering a fastq file to remove reads mapping to the lambda
        phage genome (control DNA used in nanopore sequencing). Uses
        `minimap2/mappy <https://github.com/lh3/minimap2>`__.
        
        Modules
        ~~~~~~~
        
        **`nanoget <https://github.com/wdecoster/nanoget>`__**: Functions for
        extracting features from reads, alignments and albacore summary data,
        parallelized.
        
        **`nanomath <https://github.com/wdecoster/nanomath>`__**: Functions for
        mathematical processing and calculating statistics.
        
        **`nanoplotter <https://github.com/wdecoster/nanoplotter>`__**:
        Appropriate plotting functions, building on the
        `seaborn <https://seaborn.pydata.org/>`__ module.
        
        Test data
        ~~~~~~~~~
        
        **`nanotest <https://github.com/wdecoster/nanotest>`__** provides small
        test datasets in fastq, bam and summary format (not included when
        installing NanoPack)
