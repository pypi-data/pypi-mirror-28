        Overview
        --------
        
        Burlap is a `configuration
        management <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_open-source_configuration_management_software>`__
        tool and framework for deploying software to servers.
        
        It's written in Python and is built ontop of
        `Fabric <http://www.fabfile.org/>`__ to run commands remotely over SSH.
        
        Unlike `Chef <https://www.chef.io/>`__ or
        `Ansible <http://www.ansible.com/>`__ that target large "web-scale"
        platforms at the expense of great complexity, Burlap targets small to
        medium-scale platforms and keeps its configuration simple.
        
        Much of the code is also heavily influenced by
        `Fabtools <https://github.com/fabtools/fabtools>`__, another
        Fabric-based toolkit.
