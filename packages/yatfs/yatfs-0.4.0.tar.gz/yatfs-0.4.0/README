------------------------------
yet another torrent filesystem
------------------------------

``yatfs`` is a filesystem where every file is backed by bittorrent.

You can work with the file and directory structure in a ``yatfs`` filesystem
like any other -- make directories, make symlinks/hardlinks, and move things
around. However all files are read-only.
