Releases
========

Version 2.2, January 9, 2018
----------------------------

* Update output format to match closer to pytest styling.
* Drop support for Python 3.3 (it is end-of-life).

Version 2.1, August 12, 2017
----------------------------

* Add support for Python 3.6.
* Fix crash when running with pytest-xdist (#27).

Version 2.0, August 1, 2016
---------------------------

* Update to tap.py 2.0.
  This update drops the indirect dependencies on nose and pygments.
* Improve handling of skips and xfails.
* Suppress ``# TAP results for TestCase`` for streaming.

-----------------------------------

* Initial release as stand-alone plugin.
  The version number aligns with tappy.
