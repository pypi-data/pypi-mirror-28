Overview
========

Angle based Joint and Individual Variation Explained (AJIVE) is a
dimensionality reduction algorithm for the multi-block setting i.e. K
different data matrices, with the same set of observations and
(possibly) different numbers of variables. **AJIVE finds joint modes
of variation which are common to all K data blocks as well as modes of
*individual* variation which are specific to each block.** For a
detailed discussion of AJIVE see `Angle-Based Joint and Individual
Variation Explained`_.

An R version of this package can be found `here`_.

Installation
============
To install use pip:

::

    pip install jive


Or clone the repo:

::

    git clone https://github.com/idc9/py_jive.git
    python setup.py install

Example
=======

.. code:: python

    import numpy as np
    from jive.Jive import Jive
    from jive.jive_visualization import plot_jive_full_estimates

    X = np.load('data/toy_ajive_fig2_x.npy')
    Y = np.load('data/toy_ajive_fig2_y.npy')
    blocks = [X, Y]

    # fit JIVE
    jive = Jive(blocks)
    jive.compute_initial_svd()
    jive.scree_plots()
    jive.set_signal_ranks([2, 3]) # select signal ranks based on scree plot
    jive.estimate_jive_spaces()

    full_block_estimates = jive.get_block_full_estimates()
    plot_jive_full_estimates(full_block_estimates, blocks)

For some more example code see `this notebook`_.

is the `AJIVE paper`_.

Testing
^^^^^^^

Testing is done using `nose`_.

Contributing
^^^^^^^^^^^^

We welcome contributions to make this a stronger package: data examples,
bug fixes, spelling errors, new features, etc.

Citation
^^^^^^^^

A `Journal of Statistical Software`_ paper is hopefully coming soonâ€¦
