Description: Markdown Table Of Contents
        ==========================
        
        Automatically generate a table of contents for a markdown file to improve
        document readability.
        
        The table of contents generated by this program is designed to work with
        markdown parsers such as the one used by GitHub and GitLab.
        
        When used with the in-place option this script will write the table of 
        contents at the first occurrency of a marker. The default marker is ``[](TOC)`` 
        which will result as invisible when reading the parsed markdown file.
        
        Titles up to three indentation levels (in HTML: ``h1``, ``h2``, ``h3``) will be 
        included in the table of contents.
        
        As a final remark, it is possible to generate an ordered and an unordered table 
        of contents. In both cases, each element of the toc is a clickable link to a 
        paragraph in the page.
