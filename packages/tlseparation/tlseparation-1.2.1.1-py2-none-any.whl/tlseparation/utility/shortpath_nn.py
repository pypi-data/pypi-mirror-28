    """
    Function to calculate the shortest path of all reachable points in an
    array to a base point. This function will use a combined approach to
    make sure that as many points as possible are converted to the graph
    and, therefore, evaluated.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr: array
        N-dimensional array (m x n) containing a set of parameters (n) over
        a set of observations (m) to apply the shortest path on.
    n_neighbors: int
        Number of nearest neighbors to search for in order to connect all
        entries in arr to form a graph.
    base: array_like
        N-dimensional array to use as base point coordinates for the shortest
        path calculation.
    dist_threshold: float
        Parameter to limit the creation of an edge longer than a distance
        threshold.
    return_path: boolean
        Option to select if the function should return the indices of entries
        from 'arr' that are part of the shortest paths.

    Returns
    -------
    nodes: array
        N-dimensional array (m x n) of nodes from the shortest path containing
        a set of parameters (n) over a set of observations (m).
    distance: array_like
        Accumulated distance from the base for each node.
    Path: nested_lists
        Lists of indices of entried from 'arr' that are part of the paths for
        each node.
