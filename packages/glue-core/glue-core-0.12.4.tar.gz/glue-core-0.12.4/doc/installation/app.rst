Standalone Application
======================

**Platforms:** MacOS X

Mac users with OS X >= 10.7 can download Glue as a `standalone program
<http://mac.glueviz.org>`_. This is a fast way to get started with using
Glue, but this application includes its own version of Python, and will not
recognize any packages in other Python installations. If you want to use glue in
your existing Python installation, follow instructions in the other sections.
Note that there may be a delay between when a release is announced, and when the
dmg installer is available.
