Description: ===========================
        summa visualization module
        ===========================
        
        This module intends to provide a visualization of the graph built by summa for
        producing the results.
        
        Usage:
        
            >>> text = """Automatic summarization is the process of reducing a text document with a
            computer program in order to create a summary that retains the most important points
            of the original document. As the problem of information overload has grown, and as
            the quantity of data has increased, so has interest in automatic summarization.
            Technologies that can make a coherent summary take into account variables such as
            length, writing style and syntax. An example of the use of summarization technology
            is search engines such as Google. Document summarization is another."""
        
            >>> from visualization.export import gexf_export
            >>> gexf_export(text, path="graph.gexf")
        
        This uses version 0.1.0 of the summarization module and works in Python 2.7.
