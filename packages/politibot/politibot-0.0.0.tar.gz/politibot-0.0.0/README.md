# Politibot

A bunch of API wrappers for political data with some attempt to unify them
in a way that works for me.

Not yet flight-ready, but some working scripts are in the demo folder

# Sub-packages

### ProPublica.Congress

The ProPublica Congress API for profiles of legislators.

### ProPublica.CampaignFinance

The ProPublica API (largely a better version of the standard FEC.gov API)
for data on ccandidates and committees.

### Fec

The standard FEC.gov API, for things missing from ProPublica.CampaignFinance

### ConAssembly

Connecticut General Assembly data straight from their FTP site. Open States
has much of this, but I'm waiting for Open States v2 before I add that in.

# Demo code

There's some demo code in the demo dir.
