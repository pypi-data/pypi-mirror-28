        sudoku-cli
        ==========
        
        A CLI tool for solving sudoku puzzles.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        ::
        
          pip install sudoku-cli
        
        Commands
        ========
        
        The help page for the ``sudoku`` command is a good overview:
        
        ::
        
          Usage: sudoku [OPTIONS]
        
            A command line tool for taking a file encoding sudoku problems and writing
            their solutions to either stdout (by default) or an output file.
        
          Options:
            -i, --input_file TEXT   File containing encoded sudoku problems.  [required]
            -o, --output_file TEXT  File to write solutions to.
            -s, --size INTEGER      Size of the encoded sudoku problems. Defaults to 9.
            --help                  Show this message and exit.
        
        
        input_file
        ----------
        
        The input file consists of one sudoku problem per line, where each line is a 
        string of integers in the range ``0``-``9``. A ``0`` denotes an empty location 
        while all the other digits are filled cells. This string represents a walk 
        through the grid from top to bottom and left to right.
        
        So this board:
        
        ::
        
          |0 9 0| |0,0,0| |0,0,6|
          |0 0 0| |9,6,0| |4,8,5|
          |0 0 0| |5,8,1| |0,0,0|
        
          |0,0,4| |0,0,0| |0,0,0|
          |5,1,7| |2,0,0| |9,0,0|
          |6,0,2| |0,0,0| |3,7,0|
          
          |1,0,0| |8,0,4| |0,2,0|
          |7,0,6| |0,0,0| |8,1,0|
          |3,0,0| |0,9,0| |0,0,0|
        
        Would be encoded by the string
        
        ::
        
          090000006000960485000581000004000000517200900602000370100804020706000810300090000
        
        output_file
        -----------
        
        By default the output of the command is piped to stdout but if an output file 
        is specified the solutions will be written to that file encoded in the 
        standard format.
        
        Development
        ===========
        
        A Makefile is included to simplify the running of some common commands. 
        
        To install the requirements for local development:
        
        ::
        
          make requirements
        
        To run the tests along with a coverage report and linting:
        
        ::
        
          make test
        
        To install the package locally for testing:
        
        ::
        
          make install
        
        To run the benchmarks:
        
        ::
        
          make benchmark
