spidy Web Crawler
=================

Spidy (/spˈɪdi/) is the simple, easy to use command line web crawler.
Given a list of web links, it uses Python
```requests`` <http://docs.python-requests.org>`__ to query the
webpages, and ```lxml`` <http://lxml.de/index.html>`__ to extract all
links from the page. Pretty simple!
