Description: 
        Rind
        ====
        
        Rind (Run in Docker) is a simple command line tool for executing things inside docker containers.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Whilst Rind is a Python package and can be installed with `pip`, the preferred method of installed is to download the latest binary release and place it somewhere on the system ``PATH``
        
        
        Configuration
        -------------
        
        To `rind` enable a container a  ``app.rind`` label needs to be added. Do do this in a ``docker-compose.yml`` you would do the following:
        
        .. code-block:: yaml
        
            services:
                a_service:
                    image: an_image
                    labels:
                        - app.rind
        
        
        Rind also has the ability to run pre-steps when executing inside the container. For example activating a Python virtualenv.
        
        In fact this is the *only* support pre-step currently. Ideas of others are welcome.
        
        To enable the virtualenv automatically prior to executing you need to add a value to your label.
        
        .. code-block:: yaml
        
            services:
                a_service:
                    image: an_image
                    labels:
                        app.rind: "python"
        
        
        Currently this assumes you virtualenv is at ``/venv`` within your docker container.
        
        
        Running
        -------
        
        Effectively anything passed as a command line argument is executed directly within the rind enabled container. e.g.
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            rind ./manage.py migration
        
        
        Would run the ``manage.py`` script in the containers working directory, passing it the ``migrate`` argument
        
        If no parameters are passed to ``rind`` then the default ``/bin/sh`` is used which will give you and interactive terminal.
