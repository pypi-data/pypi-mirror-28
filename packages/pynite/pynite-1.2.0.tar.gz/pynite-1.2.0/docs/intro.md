# Welcome to the pynite Docs!

### Introduction
Welcome to PyNiteâ„¢! PyNite is an asynchronous Python wrapper for the [Fortnite Tracker Network](https://fortnitetracker.com). The wrapper is currently in progress, meaning we are **currently** developing more wrapper classes, but for now, all the data from FTN should be accessible to you, albeit in a more difficult manner.

### Installation
PyNite is available through `pip`.
#### To install:
```
pip install pynite
```
This should install PyNite along with its dependencies. If for some reason the dependencies are not installed, PyNite will not work correctly. You can manually install the dependencies through
`pip install aiohttp` and `pip install python-box`

You can update pynite by running ```pip install -U pynite```. The current stable version is `1.2.0`.

PyNite requires Python 3.6 or later versions.
