        ==========
        
        An ASGI channel layer that uses AMQP as its backing store with group support.
        
        *IMPORTANT*
        -----------
        
        This library expects your Django project to have a model called ChannelGroup.
        You will need to fix the import of `ChannelGroup` in the code to make it work
        with your django project.
        
        See an example here: https://github.com/ansible/awx/blob/devel/awx/main/models/channels.py
        
        Eventually I make this part of the configuration options so you can just pass
        in `project.model.MyModel` in your `settings.py` file.
        
        
        Example Model::
        
            from django.db import models
        
            class ChannelGroup(models.Model):
                group = models.CharField(max_length=200, unique=True)
                channels = models.TextField()
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        You'll need to instantiate the channel layer with at least ``url``,
        and other options if you need them.
        
        Example::
        
            channel_layer = AMQPChannelLayer(
                url="amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672//",
                }
            )
        
        host
        ~~~~
        
        The server to connect to as a URL.
