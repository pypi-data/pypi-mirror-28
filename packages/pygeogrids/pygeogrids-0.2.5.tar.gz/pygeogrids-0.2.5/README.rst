pygeogrids
==========

This is a package for creation and handling of Discrete Global Grids or Point
collections. We hope extend the interface also to projected grids(images) in the
future.

For now the main features are:

-  Creation of grids
-  Nearest neighbor search
-  conversion of grid piont indices to lat, lon
-  Storage of grids and loading grids from CF-compatible netCDF files
-  Calculation of lookup tables between grids
-  Support for different Geodetic Datums using pyproj.

Installation
------------

To install the package use pip 6.0 or later. On linux systems `pykdtree
<https://github.com/storpipfugl/pykdtree>`__ will be installed whereas on
windows systems `scipy <http://www.scipy.org/>`__ ``cKDTree`` will be used.
pykdtree is faster than the scipy implementation but it is at the moment
not available for Windows systems.
