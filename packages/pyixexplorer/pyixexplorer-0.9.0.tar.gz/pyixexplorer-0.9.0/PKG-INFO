Description: 
        TGN - Traffic Generator
        IXE - IxExplorer
        
        This package implements Python OO API for Ixia IxExplorer traffic generator.
        
        
        Functionality
        The current version supports the following test flow:
        	Build configuration -> Start/Stop traffic -> Get statistics.
        Supported operations:
        	- Load configuration - reserve ports and load configuration (prt or str)
        	- Basic operations - get/set attributes, get/create children
        	- Start/Stop - transmit, capture
        	- Statistics - ports, streams and packet groups
        	- Save configuration (prt or str)
        	- Disconnect
        The package also support Add/Remove objects so it supports the following test case:
        	Load configuration -> Get/Set attributes -> Start/Stop traffic -> Get statistics.
        But this is less elaborated and documented at this version.
        
        TODO
        
        Ideas:
        - Add per member set flag. Will be enable by default, except for list of known attributes.
        - Add set list of attributes, get before, config each attribute in the list,, set after.
        - Make order in low level commands (ix_* style) and higher level (get/set_attributes etc.)
        - Python 3 (latest?) high priority  
        
        Short term:
        - Reset all stream sub commands to default when adding stream?
        - Reset all port sub-commands when reseting port? 
        - Stream (packet group) statistics
        - Per port stream stats
        - Set + set default automatically - not too much calls?
        	add a global flag for automatic set or not 
        	In case of True, the user will have to call the object's write function at the end
        - Get specific list of counters instead of all
        	Read_stats will get a list of stats to get, or empty == read all - Medium
        - Add from/to to stop_capture. See if IxeCaptureBuffer can be refactored so it does not have special ix_ methods.
        
        Architecture:
        - session is static object.
        - Full documentation
        - Full regression with tox, covarage etc.
        
        Longer term:
        - Should we clear stats on start traffic?
        - Refine set_attributes for port etc - IxeObjectWithWrite?
        - Use statList command?
        - Local Tcl
        - Full support for Linux server (including error detection)
        - Better error messages
        	- Test if Tcl server and chassis on the same version
        	- add proper exception regarding miss match on multi server\chassis version
        - Implicit load configuration
        - Get/Set Enums
        - Full support for Linux clients (over sockets only)
        - Improve stream stats - performance, single stream only, set implicitly
        - Load cfg
        
        Installation:
        stable - pip instsll ixeooapi
        
        Prerequisite:
        In case of Linux IxOS - IxExplorer application installed.
        
        Related works:
        The low level API of the package is based on python-ixia package - https://github.com/kontron/python-ixia.
