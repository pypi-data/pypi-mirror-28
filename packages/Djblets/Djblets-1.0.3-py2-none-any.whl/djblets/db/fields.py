class CounterField(models.IntegerField):
    """A field that provides atomic counter updating and smart initialization.

    The CounterField makes it easy to atomically update an integer,
    incrementing or decrementing it, without raise conditions or conflicts.
    It can update a single instance at a time, or a batch of objects at once.

    CounterField is useful for storing counts of objects, reducing the number
    of queries performed. This requires that the calling code properly
    increments or decrements at all the right times, of course.

    This takes an optional ``initializer`` parameter that, if provided, can
    be used to auto-populate the field the first time the model instance is
    loaded, perhaps based on querying a number of related objects. The value
    passed to ``initializer`` must be a function taking the model instance
    as a parameter, and must return an integer or None. If it returns None,
    the counter will not be updated or saved.

    The model instance will gain four new functions:

        * ``increment_{field_name}`` - Atomically increment by one.
        * ``decrement_{field_name}`` - Atomically decrement by one.
        * ``reload_{field_name}`` - Reload the value in this instance from the
                                    database.
        * ``reinit_{field_name}`` - Re-initializes the stored field using the
                                    initializer function.

    The field on the class (not the instance) provides two functions for
    batch-updating models:

        * ``increment`` - Takes a queryset and increments this field for
                          each object.
        * ``decrement`` - Takes a queryset and decrements this field for
                          each object.
