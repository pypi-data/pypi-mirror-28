        Sorting Algorithms
        ========================
        
        This project includes implementations of the following sorting algorithms:
        
        1. Bubble sort: In bubble sort, we repeatedly swap the adjancent elements if they are in wrong order. It's time complexity is O(N*N)
        
        2. Insertion sort: In insertion sort, we start with a sub-list of size 2, and insert the right-most elements to the proper location 
           in such a way that the list remains sorted. It's time complexity is O(N*N)
        
        3. merge sort: In merge sort, we use divide and conquer strategy and sort the sublists and merge them recursively. It's time complexity
           is O(N*logN)
        
        I will be adding more sorting algorithms to this project.
