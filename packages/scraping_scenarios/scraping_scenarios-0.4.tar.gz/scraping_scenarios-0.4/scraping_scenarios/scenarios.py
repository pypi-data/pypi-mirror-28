            This scraping scenario is for the search websites. It will collect search results.
            Three steps: 1) enter the search string, 2) collect results from the page 3) get the next page.
            For the first step we can just insert the search query in the url ( works for at least for
            bing, yandex, duckduckgo). Then, as we get the page, using the xpath for the result url, we collect them.
            Once we collected result urls, we move to the next page. To do that, we will need an xpath for the
            next page button. Specifically for button's @href attribute. As we get the url for the next page, we do the
            step 2 again, basically looping through steps 2 and 3 until there is not next page.
            There is also can be a limitation to the maximum number of result pages to scrape result urls from.
            page_limit by default is 0, which means that there is no page limit.
