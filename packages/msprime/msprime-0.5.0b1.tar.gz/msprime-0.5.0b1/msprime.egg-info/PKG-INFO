Description: =======
        msprime
        =======
        
        Msprime is a reimplementation of Hudson's classical ms program for modern
        datasets. It provides a convenient Python API and HDF5-based storage format, as
        well as the ``mspms`` command line interface. This program provides a fully
        ``ms`` compatible interface, and can be used as a drop-in replacement in
        existing workflows.
        
        Msprime can simulate the coalescent with recombination much
        faster than programs based on the Sequentially Markov Coalescent
        for large sample sizes and has very reasonable memory requirements. Msprime
        makes it possible to simulate chromosome sized regions with hundreds of
        thousands of samples.
