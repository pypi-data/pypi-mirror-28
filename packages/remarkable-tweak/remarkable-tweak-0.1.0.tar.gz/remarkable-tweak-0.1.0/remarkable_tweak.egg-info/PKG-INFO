        Instructions
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        -  Install python 3.x from
           `python.org <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`__ (if you're on
           linux, this is probably already on your system)
        
        -  In a terminal or console window enter
           ``pip install remarkable-tweak``. This should take care of the
           installation for you, however on some systems you may have to use
           ``pip3`` as the command instead.
        
        -  Run the tool with the command ``remarkable-tweak`` either from a
           terminal window, Windows' 'Run' dialog, or similar. Your reMarkable
           has to be connected via the stock USB cable.
        
        -  You also need your tablet's password, which you find under
           About->'GPLv3 Compliance' (lower right corner of About-screen)
        
           -  To get to this menu, you simply tap the 'rM' logo in the top left
              corner of your overview-screen.
