About timeboard
***************

:py:mod:`timeboard` performs calendar calculations over business schedules such as business days or work shifts.

Examples of problems solved by :py:mod:`timeboard`: 

- If we have 20 business days to complete the project, when will be the deadline? 

- If a person was employed from November 15 to December 22, how many month's salaries the company owes them?

- A 24x7 call center operates in shifts of varying length. An operator comes in on every fourth shift. How many hours has the operator worked in a specific month?

Based on pandas timeseries library, :py:mod:`timeboard` gives more flexibility than pandas's built-in business calendars limited to a weekly pattern of days. The key features of :py:mod:`timeboard` are:

    - Workshifts of any duration from seconds to years.
    - Tools to build sophisticated schedules which can combine periodical patterns, seasonal variations, stop-and-resume behavior, etc.
    - Built-in standard business day calendars for USA, UK, and Russia.
