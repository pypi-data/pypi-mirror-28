Quick Start Guide
*****************

Firstly, you need to build a timeboard (calendar). The simplest way to do it is to use a preconfigured calendar which is shipped with the package. Let's take a regular business day calendar for the United States. ::

    >>> import timeboard.calendars.US as US
    >>> clnd = US.Weekly8x5()

Now you may perform queries and calculations over your timeboard.


**Is a certain date a business day?** 
::

    >>> ws = clnd('27 May 2017')
    >>> ws.is_on_duty()
    False

Indeed, it was a Saturday. 


**When was the next business day?** 
::

    >>> ws.rollforward()
    Workshift(6359) of 'D' at 2017-05-30

It tells us that this calendar's unit (workshift) has the sequence number of 6359 and covers a period of 'D' (day) on 30 May 2017, which, by the way, was the Tuesday after the Memorial Day holiday.


**If we were to finish the project in 22 business days starting on 01 May 2017, when would be our deadline?** 
::

    >>> clnd('01 May 2017') + 22
    Workshift(6361) of 'D' at 2017-06-01


**When was the first business day in 2017?** 
::

    >>> clnd('2017', period='A').first()
    Workshift(6212) of 'D' at 2017-01-03


**How many business days were in a certain month?** 
::
    >>> clnd('May 2017', period='M').count()
    22


**How many days off?** 
::
    >>> clnd('May 2017', period='M').count(duty='off')
    9


**How many working hours?**
::
    >>> clnd('May 2017', period='M').sum()
    176.0


**If an employee was on staff from the 3rd to the 28th of April, 2017, how many business months did this person work in the company?** 
::
    >>> clnd(('03 Apr 2017','28 Apr 2017')).count_periods('M')
    1.0

Indeed, the 1st, the 2nd, as well as the 29th and the 30th of April in 2017 fell on the weekends, therefore, having started on the 3rd and finished on the 28th, the employee checked out all the working days in the month.


**And if it were the same dates in May?** 
::
    >>> clnd(('03 May 2017','28 May 2017')).count_periods('M')
    0.8181818181818182
