django-image-styles
===================

Simple, fast and easy-to-use tool for pre-rendering images on Django.

Features
--------

-  Renders images and stores them so they don't need to be re-rendered.
-  Doesn't modify the original images.
-  Completely independend from other models.
-  Has the following effects (based on Pillow):
-  Crop
-  Enhance
-  Resize
-  Rotate
-  Scale Proportionally
-  Scale by width or height (Smart Scale)
-  Round Corners
-  Render in **Templates** or via **URL**
-  Effect Management Utility

Installation
------------

If you haven't install libjpeg-dev:

::

    sudo apt-get install libjpeg-dev

Apply to an existing django project:

::

    pip install django-image-styles

Add to installed apps in your project ``settings.py`` and the MEDIA
settings:

::

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        image_styles,
        ...
    )
    ...
    MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
    MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR,'media')

Run migrations and the initial data of the module.

::

    python manage.py migrate

You are done! :)

Recommendations
---------------

Just to ensure a proper server configuration, if you are prototyping
using Django's ``runserver``, be sure to add the following lines to your
``my_project/urls.py`` file as described in the `Django 1.8
documentation <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/howto/static-files/>`__:

::

    ...
    from django.conf.urls.static import static
    from django.conf.urls import include
    from django.conf import settings
    ...
    urlpatterns = [
       ...
    ] + static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)

It is also recommended to add the
``'django.template.context_processors.media'`` context processor to the
template settings in the ``my_project/settings.py`` file to be able to
use the ``{{MEDIA_URL}}`` tag in your templates:

::

    TEMPLATES = [
        {
            'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates',
            ...
            'OPTIONS': {
                'context_processors': [
                    ...
                    'django.template.context_processors.media',
                ]
            }
        }
    ]

    This is only a recommendation since the Django documentation is not
    that clear about how to do this and people have many different ways
    of approaching this.

Rendering images via Templates
------------------------------

At the top of your template:

::

    ...
    {% load image_styles %}
    ...

Method 1
~~~~~~~~

::

    ...
    {% render_image image 'Small Thumbnail' 'Optional Image Description' %}
    ...

Or you can simply add the ID of the format:

::

    ...
    {% render_image image 1 %}
    ...

Method 2
~~~~~~~~

::

    ...
    <img src="{{MEDIA_URL}}{{image|style:'Small Thumbnail'}}" alt="Image Description">
    ...

Rendering images via URL
------------------------

To add this feature you need to add the path to the
´my\_project/urls.py´ file like so:

::

    ...
        url(r'^image_styles/', include('image_styles.urls')),
    ...

Now you can use
``http://localhost:8000/image_styles/<style id>/<path to your image>``
to load images with a URL. This feature is VERY useful when dealing with
APIs and trying to retreive the correct styled and sized image to a
mobile app. This can also be used in a template like this:

::

    ...
    <img src="{% url 'render_image' 1 image.name %}">
    ...

Where ``1`` is the style id and ``image`` is a
``django.models.ImageField`` object.

Rendering images via Views
--------------------------

This is useful when outputting images for API resources.

Import the *reverse* function at the top of the ``views.py`` file.

::

    ...
    from django.core.urlresolvers import reverse
    from image_styles.utils import render_image
    from django.conf import settings
    ...

Finally you can get the image like so:

::

    rendered_image = render_image(1,image.name)
    image_url = settings.MEDIA_URL[:-1]+reverse(
        'render_image',
        kwargs={
            'style_name':'thumbnail',
            'path':image.name
        }
    )

Where ``1`` is the style id and ``image`` is a
``django.models.ImageField`` object.

Default Styles
--------------

The module includes 4 simple styles: - Small Thumbnail - a 100px by
100px thumbnail. - Gallery - a 1024px by **proportional height** image.
- Page Header - 1024px by 600px image useful for header backgrounds. -
Post Thumbnail - a 250px by 160px thumbnail.

This styles can be edited at any time if you like.

Manage your styles
------------------

To crate a style you need to follow the next steps: \* As shown in the
**Rendering images via URL** section, you need to add the
``url(r'^image_styles/', include('image_styles.urls')),`` path to your
root ``urls.py`` file. \* To access the image styles admin interface
simply go to ``http://localhost:8000/image_styles/``.

If a style is modified in any way, it will be resetted and the new
images will be re-rendered when needed. The admin site is **only
available for staff users**.

Limitations
-----------

-  Since the system has no way of telling if the original images have
   been deleted or modified, the rendered images can still be shown if
   the right url is called. The way of preventing this (and the
   *correct* thing to do) is to rename the file if the image object has
   changed.
-  Images with no alpha channels may be filled with a black background.
