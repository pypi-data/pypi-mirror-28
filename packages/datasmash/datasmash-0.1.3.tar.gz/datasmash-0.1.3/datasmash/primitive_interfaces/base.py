        """
        Produce primitive's best choice of the output for each of the inputs.

        In many cases producing an output is a quick operation in comparison with ``fit``, but not
        all cases are like that. For example, a primitive can start a potentially long optimization
        process to compute outputs. ``timeout`` and ``iterations`` can serve as a way for a caller
        to guide the length of this process.

        Ideally, a primitive should adapt its call to try to produce the best outputs possible
        inside the time allocated. If this is not possible and the primitive reaches the timeout
        before producing outputs, it should raise a ``TimeoutError`` exception to signal that the
        call was unsuccessful in the given time. The state of the primitive after the exception
        should be as the method call has never happened and primitive should continue to operate
        normally. The purpose of ``timeout`` is to give opportunity to a primitive to cleanly
        manage its state instead of interrupting execution from outside. Maintaining stable internal
        state should have precedence over respecting the ``timeout`` (caller can terminate the
        misbehaving primitive from outside anyway). If a longer ``timeout`` would produce
        different outputs, then ``get_call_metadata``'s ``has_finished`` should be set to
        ``False``.

        Some primitives have internal iterations (for example, optimization iterations).
        For those, caller can provide how many of primitive's internal iterations
        should a primitive do before returning outputs. Primitives should make iterations as
        small as reasonable. If ``iterations`` is ``None``, then there is no limit on
        how many iterations the primitive should do and primitive should choose the best amount
        of iterations on its own (potentially controlled through hyper-parameters).
        If ``iterations`` is a number, a primitive has to do those number of iterations,
        if possible. ``timeout`` should still be respected and potentially less iterations
        can be done because of that. Primitives with internal iterations should make
        ``get_call_metadata`` returns correct values.

        For primitives which do not have internal iterations, any value of ``iterations``
        means that they should run fully, respecting only ``timeout``.

        Fits primitive using inputs and outputs (if any) using currently set training data.

        If ``fit`` has already been called in the past on different training data,
        this method fits it **again from scratch** using currently set training data.

        On the other hand, caller can call ``fit`` multiple times on the same training data
        to continue fitting.

        If ``fit`` fully fits using provided training data, there is no point in making further
        calls to this method with same training data, and in fact further calls can be noops,
        or a primitive can decide to refit from scratch.

        In the case fitting can continue with same training data (even if it is maybe not reasonable,
        because the internal metric primitive is using looks like fitting will be degrading), if ``fit``
        is called again (without setting training data), the primitive has to continue fitting.

        Caller can provide ``timeout`` information to guide the length of the fitting process.
        Ideally, a primitive should adapt its fitting process to try to do the best fitting possible
        inside the time allocated. If this is not possible and the primitive reaches the timeout
        before fitting, it should raise a ``TimeoutError`` exception to signal that fitting was
        unsuccessful in the given time. The state of the primitive after the exception should be

        The purpose of ``timeout`` is to give opportunity to a primitive to cleanly manage
        its state instead of interrupting execution from outside. Maintaining stable internal state
        should have precedence over respecting the ``timeout`` (caller can terminate the misbehaving
        primitive from outside anyway). If a longer ``timeout`` would produce different fitting,
        then ``get_call_metadata``'s ``has_finished`` should be set to ``False``.

        Some primitives have internal fitting iterations (for example, epochs). For those, caller
        can provide how many of primitive's internal iterations should a primitive do before returning.
        Primitives should make iterations as small as reasonable. If ``iterations`` is ``None``,
        then there is no limit on how many iterations the primitive should do and primitive should

        and potentially less iterations can be done because of that. Primitives with internal
        iterations should make ``get_call_metadata`` returns correct values.

        For primitives which do not have internal iterations, any value of ``iterations``
        means that they should fit fully, respecting only ``timeout``.

        Subclasses can extend arguments of this method with explicit typed keyword arguments used during
        the fitting process. For example, they can accept other primitives through an argument representing
        a regularizer to use during fitting. The reason why those are not part of constructor arguments is
        that one can create primitives in any order before having to invoke them or pass them to other
        primitives.

        Parameters
        ----------
        timeout : float
            A maximum time this primitive should be fitting during this method call, in seconds.
        iterations : int

        has produced the final outputs and a call with more time or more iterations
        cannot get different outputs.

        For ``fit``, ``has_finished`` is ``True`` if a primitive has been fully fitted
        on current training data and further calls to ``fit`` are unnecessary and will
        not change anything. ``False`` means that more iterations can be done (but it
        does not necessary mean that more iterations are beneficial).

        The reason why this is a separate call is to make return value from ``produce`` and
        ``fit`` simpler. Moreover, not all callers might care about this information and for
        many primitives a default implementation of this method works.

        """
        Similar to base ``fit``, this method fits the primitive using inputs and outputs (if any)
        using currently set training data.

        The difference is what happens when currently set training data is different from
        what the primitive might have already been fitted on. ``fit`` fits the primitive from
        scratch, while ``continue_fit`` fits it further and does **not** start from scratch.

        Caller can still call ``continue_fit`` multiple times on the same training data as well,
        in which case primitive should try to improve the fit in the same way as with ``fit``.

        From the perspective of a caller of all other methods, the training data in effect
        is still just currently set training data. If a caller wants to call ``gradient_output``
        on all data on which the primitive has been fitted through multiple calls of ``continue_fit``
        on different training data, the caller should pass all this data themselves through
        another call to ``set_training_data``, do not call ``fit`` or ``continue_fit`` again,
        and use ``gradient_output`` method. In this way primitives which truly support
        continuation of fitting and need only the latest data to do another fitting, do not
        have to keep all past training data around themselves.

        If a primitive supports this mixin, then both ``fit`` and ``continue_fit`` can be
        called. ``continue_fit`` always continues fitting, if it was started through ``fit``
        or ``continue_fit``. And ``fit`` always restarts fitting, even if previously
        ``continue_fit`` was used.
