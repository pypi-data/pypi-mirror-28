An ordered, one-to-many mapping.

Thread Safety
-------------
`FrozenMagicDict` and its classes should be thread safe without additional
locking. If any data races occurred during using, then that's a bug. Please
file an issue with reproducing procedure.

Usage
-----
`MagicDict` should function like a `collections.OrderedDict` except
`move_to_end` is not defined and the item selection always returns the first
item. It it is not, submit an issue.

`FrozenMagicDict` is an immutable version of `MagicDict`.
Also, compared to `MagicDict`, `FrozenMagicDict` is lockless. Hence,
when an action is available in both dictionaries, `FrozenMagicDict` is usually
faster.

`FrozenTolerantMagicDict` and `TolerantMagicDict` are case-insensitive version
of `FrozenMagicDict` and `MagicDict` respectively.

`get_first`, `get_last`, `get_iter`, and `get_list`:
These methods are available in `FrozenMagicDict` and its subclasses to get the
elements. For more details, please read the comments of each method.

`add`:
Method `add` is available in `MagicDict` and `TolerantMagicDict`. This method
is used as an instead of `dic["key"] = "value"` as it can append a value to the
dictionary without removing the former one. Setting values like normal
`OrderedDict` will clear the stored value(s) if any.
