        # GenomeQAML: Genome Quality Assesment with Machine Learning
        
        The GenomeQAML is a script that uses a pre-computed ExtraTreesClassifier model in order to 
        classify FASTA-formatted _de novo_ assemblies as bad, good, or very good. It's easy to use,
        and has minimal dependencies.
        
        ## External Dependencies
        
        - [Mash (v2.0 or greater)](https://github.com/marbl/mash)
        - [Prodigal (>=2.6.2)](https://github.com/hyattpd/Prodigal)
        
        Both of these need to be downloaded and included on your $PATH.
        
        ## Installation
        
        All you need to do is install with pip: `pip install genomeqaml`. 
        
        Usage of a virtualenv
        is highly recommended.
        
        ## Usage
        
        GenomeQAML takes a directory containing uncompressed fasta files as input - these will be classified and
        the results printed to your screen.
        
        To run, type `classify.py -t /path/to/fasta/folder`
