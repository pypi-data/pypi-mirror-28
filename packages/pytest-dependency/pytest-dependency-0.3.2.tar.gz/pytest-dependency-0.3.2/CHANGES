               History of changes to pytest-dependency
               =======================================

* Version 0.3.2 (2018-01-17)

** Bug fixes and minor changes

 + Issue #5: properly register the dependency marker.

 + Do not add the documentation to the source distribution.

* Version 0.3.1 (2017-12-26)

** Bug fixes and minor changes

 + Issue #17: Move the online documentation to Read the Docs

 + Some improvements in the documentation.

* Version 0.3 (2017-12-26)

** New features

 + Issue #7: Add a configuration switch to implicitly mark all tests.

 + Issue #10: Add an option to ignore unknown dependencies.

** Incompatible changes

 + Prepend the class name to the default test name for test class
   methods.  This fixes a potential name conflict, see Issue #6.

   If your code uses test classes and you reference test methods by
   their default name, you must add the class name.  E.g. if you have
   something like:

         class TestClass(object):

             @pytest.mark.dependency()
             def test_a():
                 pass

             @pytest.mark.dependency(depends=["test_a"])
             def test_b():
                 pass

   you need to change this to:

         class TestClass(object):

             @pytest.mark.dependency()
             def test_a():
                 pass

             @pytest.mark.dependency(depends=["TestClass::test_a"])
             def test_b():
                 pass

   If you override the test name in the pytest.mark.dependency()
   marker, nothing need to be changed.

** Bug fixes and minor changes

 + PR #11: show the name of the skipped test (thanks asteriogonzalez).

 + Issue #13: Do not import pytest in setup.py to make it compatible
   with pipenv.

 + Issue #15: tests fail with pytest 3.3.0.

 + Issue #8: document incompatibility with parallelization in
   pytest-xdist.

 + Clarify in the documentation that Python 3.1 is not officially
   supported because pytest 2.8 does not support it.  There is no
   known issue with Python 3.1 though.

* Version 0.2 (2017-05-28)

** New features

 + Issue #2: Add documentation.

 + Issue #4: Add a depend() function to add a dependency to a test at
   runtime.

* Version 0.1 (2017-01-29)

 + Initial release as an independent Python module.

   This code was first developed as part of a larger package,
   python-icat, at Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin f√ºr Materialien und
   Energie, see https://icatproject.org/user-documentation/python-icat/
