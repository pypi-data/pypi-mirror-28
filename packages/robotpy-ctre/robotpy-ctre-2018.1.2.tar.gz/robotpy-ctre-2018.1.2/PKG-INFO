        ============
        
        This is a python wrapper around the CTRE 3rd party library. Documentation can be
        found at http://robotpy-ctre.readthedocs.io/

        Road Electronics.
        
        Setup (simulator)
        -----------------
        
            pip3 install robotpy-ctre
        
        Setup (RoboRIO)
        ---------------
        
        Python package
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        You really don't want to compile this yourself, so don't download this from pypi
        and install it. Instead, you can download a pre-packaged version from our opkg repository. Use the RobotPy installation script (comes with the RobotPy download), and run the following on your computer while connected to the internet::
        
          py -3 installer.py download-opkg python36-robotpy-ctre
        
        Then, when connected to the roborio's network, run::
        
          py -3 installer.py install-opkg python36-robotpy-ctre
        
        For more information about installing packages, see https://github.com/robotpy/roborio-packages
        
        NI Web Dashboard (optional)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        CTRE Phoenix can integrate with the NI Web Dashboard on the RoboRIO. This is not required to
        run robotpy-ctre on the RoboRIO, but it can be a useful diagnostic tool. To install this, you
        will need to use the CTRE Lifeboat tool to install it separately.
        
        Refer to `the CTRE documentation <https://github.com/CrossTheRoadElec/Phoenix-Documentation#installing-phoenix-framework-onto-your-frc-robot>`_
        for more details.
