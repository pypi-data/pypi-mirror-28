        NeuroCurator
        ============
        
        Desktop application to perform systematic and collaborative curation of
        neuroscientific literature.
        
        This is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for the Python package
        `NeuroAnnotation Toolbox (NAT) <https://github.com/BlueBrain/nat>`__.
        
        This framework has been described in details in the following
        open-access paper: https://doi.org/10.3389/fninf.2017.00027.
        
        With NeuroCurator, annotations are: - traceable, - reusable across
        projects, - structured with controlled vocabularies.
        
        --------------
        
        Getting Started
        ---------------
        
        **Requirements:**
        
        System side:
        
        -  `Git 1.7.0+ <https://git-scm.com/downloads>`__
        -  `ImageMagick
           6 <http://docs.wand-py.org/en/latest/guide/install.html>`__
        -  `Python 3.4\* <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`__
        -  `Qt
           4.8.7\* <https://doc.qt.io/archives/qt-4.8/supported-platforms.html>`__
        -  `Miniconda\* <https://conda.io/miniconda.html>`__
        
        Python side:
        
        -  `NAT <https://github.com/BlueBrain/nat>`__
        -  `PySide 1.2.4 <https://wiki.qt.io/PySide>`__
        -  `NumPy <http://www.numpy.org>`__
        -  `pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org>`__
        -  `Wand <http://docs.wand-py.org>`__
        
        \*Miniconda is not required. It simplifies only temporary the
        installation: no need to compile Qt and to install manually Python 3.4.
        
        **Installation:**
        
        Create a virtual environment with Python 3.4:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            conda create -y --name nc python=3.4
        
        Switch to the virtual environment:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            source activate nc
        
        Install PySide 1.2.4 and Qt 4.8.7 from
        `conda-forge <https://conda-forge.org>`__:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            conda install -y pyside --channel conda-forge
        
        Install NeuroCurator:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            pip install nat
            pip install neurocurator --no-deps
        
        Launch NeuroCurator:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            neurocurator
        
        For the future uses: 1. enter the virtual environment:
        ``source activate nc`` 2. launch NeuroCurator: ``neurocurator`` 3. use
        NeuroCurator 4. close NeuroCurator 5. exit the virtual environment:
        ``source deactivate``
        
        Releases
        --------
        
        Versions and their notable changes are listed in the `releases
        section <https://github.com/BlueBrain/neurocurator/releases/>`__.
        
        Status
        ------
        
        Created during 2016.
        
        Ongoing stabilization and reengineering in the branch
        *refactor-architecture*.
        
        The branch *refactor-architecture* is **not** intended to be used by
        end-users.
        
        New features, bug fixes and improvements are done on the reengineered
        code sections.
        
        When a reengineered code section is stable, itâ€™s merged into the branch
        *master* and a release is published.
