Description
===========

NURBS-Python provides Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS) surface and 2D/3D curve data structures and computation
algorithms in native Python. The library is fully object-oriented and does *not* depend on any external libraries.

Features
========

* Surface and 2D/3D curve classes for B-Spline (NUBS) and NURBS which include well-defined data structures and evaluation algorithms from The NURBS Book (2nd Edition) by Piegl & Tiller
* An automated uniform knot vector generator
* Control points grid generator for ``Surface`` classes
* Easy-to-extend visualization component which comes with a sample implementation which uses Matplotlib
