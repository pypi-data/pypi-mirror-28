Introduction
============

This project aims to implement Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS) curve and surface computation algorithms in native
Python with minimum possible dependencies. The library is fully object-oriented and does *not* depend on any external
C/C++ libraries.

The package contains 3 modules:

* :code:`BSpline` contains Non-Uniform B-Spline (NUBS) evaluation and storage functionality
* :code:`NURBS` contains Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS) evaluation and storage functionality
* :code:`CPGen` contains simple control points grid generation algorithms

:code:`BSpline` and :code:`NURBS` modules contain 3 classes for geometric evaluation:

* **Curve** for evaluating 3D curves
* **Curve2D** for evaluating 2D curves
* **Surface** for evaluating surfaces

:code:`CPGen` module contains 2 classes for grid generation:

* **Grid** for generating inputs for :code:`BSpline.Surface` class
* **GridWeighted** for generating inputs for :code:`NURBS.Surface` class

Information for Researchers
---------------------------

I would be glad if you cite this repository using the DOI_ provided as a badge at the top.

Library Versions
----------------

* ``master`` branch contains the latest version of NURBS-Python (currently v3.x series).
* ``2.x`` branch contains the code for *NURBS-Python v2.x* series.

There are some API changes between *v2.x* and *v3.x* series and all updates will be added to the latest version. Old
versions won't be receiving any new features and updates.

Installation
============

Using Pip
---------

You can find the NURBS-Python library on [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/NURBS-Python) and install it
using the following command:

``pip install NURBS-Python``

Manual Method
-------------

Included *setup.py* script will take care of the installation and automatically copy the required files to
*site-packages* directory. Please run the following from the command line:

``python setup.py install``

If you don't want to put the files into your Python distribution's *site-packages* directory for some reason,
you can run

``python setup.py develop``

from the command line to generate a link to the package directory inside *site-packages*.

Example Scripts
===============

Please see `NURBS-Python Examples <https://github.com/orbingol/NURBS-Python_Examples>`_ repository for examples.

Implementation
==============

NURBS-Python is a high-level Python library following the object-oriented design principles. In its core, it implements
the algorithms from **The NURBS Book (2nd Edition)** by Piegl & Tiller and combines these algorithms with other useful
features. Please see the documentation for function reference and how to use the library: http://nurbs-python.rtfd.org

Issues and Reporting
====================

Bugs and Issues
---------------

Please use the issue tracker for reporting bugs and other related issues.

Comments and Questions
----------------------

If you have any questions or comments related to the NURBS-Python package, please don't hesitate to contact the
developers by email.
