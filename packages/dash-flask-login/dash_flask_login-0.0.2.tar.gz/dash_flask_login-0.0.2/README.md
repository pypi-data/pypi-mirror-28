# Integration of Dash with Flask-Login

### Intro
#### Dash-Flask-Login is a [Dash](https://github.com/plotly/dash) to allow integration with the popular [Flask-Login](https://github.com/maxcountryman/flask-login) for user session management.  

Dash-Admin is intended to be plug and play!  Providing user authentication should be as simple as:

auth = FlaskLoginAuth(dash_app)

### Documentation

For now, please look at ```usage_dash_flask_login.py``` for an example of using login/logout forms created as separate Dash apps.  Look at ```usage_dash_flask_login_with_default_views.py``` to see an example with the default login/logout forms provided by the package.

### Installation

Dash-Flask-Login can be installed via ```pip install dash-flask-login```.
