Installation guide
==================

Before installing django-registration, you'll need to have a copy
of `Django <https://www.djangoproject.com>`_ already installed. For
information on obtaining and installing Django, consult the `Django
download page <https://www.djangoproject.com/download/>`_, which
offers convenient packaged downloads and installation instructions.

The |version| release of django-registration supports Django 1.8,
1.9, and 1.10, on the following Python versions:

* Django 1.8 supports Python 2.7, 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5.

* Django 1.9 supports Python 2.7, 3.4 and 3.5.

* Django 1.10 supports Python 2.7, 3.4 and 3.5.

It is expected that django-registration |version| will work
without modification on Python 3.6 once it is released.

.. important:: **Python 3.2**

   Although Django 1.8 supported Python 3.2 at the time of its
   release, the Python 3.2 series has reached end-of-life, and as a
   result support for Python 3.2 has been dropped from
   django-registration.


Normal installation
-------------------

The preferred method of installing django-registration is via
``pip``, the standard Python package-installation tool. If you don't
have ``pip``, instructions are available for `how to obtain and
install it <https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html>`_. If
you're using Python 2.7.9 or later (for Python 2) or Python 3.4 or
later (for Python 3), ``pip`` came bundled with your installation of
Python.

Once you have ``pip``, type::

    pip install django-registration


Installing from a source checkout
---------------------------------

If you want to work on django-registration, you can obtain a source
checkout.

The development repository for django-registration is at
<https://github.com/ubernostrum/django-registration>. If you have `git
<http://git-scm.com/>`_ installed, you can obtain a copy of the
repository by typing::

    git clone https://github.com/ubernostrum/django-registration.git

From there, you can use normal git commands to check out the specific
revision you want, and install it using ``pip install -e .`` (the
``-e`` flag specifies an "editable" install, allowing you to change
code as you work on django-registration, and have your changes picked
up automatically).
