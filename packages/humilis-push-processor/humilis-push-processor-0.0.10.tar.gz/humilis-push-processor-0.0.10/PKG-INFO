        A `humilis <https://github.com/humilis/humilis>`__ plugin to deploy a
        `Lambda <https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/lambda/>`__ function that
        processes event notification from an `event sources`_ that pushes events to
        Lambda (e.g. S3 or SNS, as opposed to Kinesis).
        
        .. _event sources: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/eventsources.html
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        ::
        
            pip install humilis-push-processor
        
        Development
        -----------
        
        Assuming you have
        `virtualenv <https://virtualenv.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`__ installed:
        
        ::
        
            make develop
        
        Configure humilis:
        
        ::
        
            .env/bin/humilis configure --local
        
        
        You can crate a development deployment (on a deployment stage called `DEV`) of
        the Lambda function using:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            make create STAGE=DEV
        
        The command above will also create additional resources (such as a S3 bucket)
        needed to produce a self-contained deployment that you can play with. You
        can destroy the `DEV` deployment using:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            make delete STAGE=DEV
        
        
        Testing
        -------
        
        To run the local test suite::
        
            make test
        
        To run the integration test suite:
        
        ::
        
            make testi STAGE=[STAGE] DESTROY=[yes|no]
        
        
        Note that the command above will deploy the processor to the specified
        deployment stage. If a deployment stage is not specified then `TEST` will be
        used. If ``DESTROY`` is set to ``yes`` all deployed resources will be deleted
        after tests have completed (this is also the default behaviour if the
        ``DESTROY`` parameter is not provided). You can manually destroy the test
        infrastructure with:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            make delete STAGE=[STAGE]
        
        
        Deployment secrets
        ------------------
        
        The S3 event processor supports `Sentry <https://getsentry.com/welcome/>`_
        monitoring out of the box. To activate it you just need to store your Sentry
        DSN in your local keychain. Using Python's `keyring <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/keyring>`_
        module::
        
            keyring set humilis-push-processor:[STAGE] sentry.dsn [SENTRY_DSN]
        
        
        Alternatively you can set environment variable ``SENTRY_DSN``
