        Hashit is an hashing program which can be uses to hash and verify muliple files on a system.
        I got the idea from an ubuntu iso image which have this hash table, so i got the idea to make
        such a program using python.
        
        ### Notice:
        some hashes as blake2b and blake2s is not supported in python2
        and all shake hashes is disabled for now
        
        ## Usage
        
        ------------------------------------
        Command line wise 
        ```bash
        (python3 -m) hashit [options] $disableFullPath
        ```
        From python you can do it like this
        ```py
        from hashit import hashlib, blockIter, hashIter
        
        file = open("somefile", "rb")
        
        # memory efficent generator
        hash = hashIter(blockIter(file, blocksize=65536), hasher=hashlib.md5(), ashexstr=True)
        
        print(hash)
        
        ```
