  Hashit is an hashing program which can be uses to hash and verify muliple files on a system.
  I got the idea from an ubuntu iso image which have this hash table, so i got the idea to make
  such a program using python.
  I also found that the linux 'standard' hashing commands was named like this
  
        md5sum
        sha1sum
        sha256sum
        cksum
        sum
  
  hashname + sum, which i thougth was a pretty lame naming convention.
