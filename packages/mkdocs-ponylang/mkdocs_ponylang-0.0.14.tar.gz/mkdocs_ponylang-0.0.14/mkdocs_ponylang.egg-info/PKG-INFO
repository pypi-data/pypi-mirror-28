Description: Ponylang Mkdocs Theme
        =====================
        
        Based on https://github.com/rtfd/sphinx_rtd_theme and https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/tree/master/mkdocs/themes/readthedocs .
        
        The sources for generating the theme files is mostly in ``src`` folder,
        it is generated using ``webpack``. The theme itself is distributed as python package
        and can be referenced in your ``mkdocs.yml`` as::
        
            theme: ponylang
        
        Setup
        -----
        
        You need to have ``npm`` installed.
        I installed it using `asdf <https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf>`_,
        but any installation method will do.
        
        Install yarn to install further dependencies::
        
            npm install -g yarn
            yarn install
        
        
        In order to regenerate the theme files inside the ``mkdocs_ponylang`` folder, run::
        
            webpack
        
        
        The Webpack executable should be in your global node installation and thus on your path.
        If not, search for it and add it to your path.
        
        For an asdf installation, adding this to my shell initialization file (e.g. ``$HOME/.bashrc``) helped::
        
            export PATH="$HOME/.asdf/installs/nodejs/$(asdf which nodejs)/.npm/bin:$PATH"
