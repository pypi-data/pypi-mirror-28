Description:     Structure to handle the
            _proprerties, _side_properties, _derived_properties
            tricks.
        
            A class inheriting from BaseObject could have the following
            global-class variables:
        
            ```
            PROPERTIES         = ["a","b"]
            SIDE_PROPERTIES    = ["t"]
            DERIVED_PROPERTIES = ["whynot"]
            ```
            if so, object created from this class or any inheriting class
            could have access to the self._properties["a"], self._properties["b"]
            self._side_properties["t"] or self._derived_properties["whynot"]
            parameters.
        
            BaseObject have a basic .copy() method.
