===========
CloudLaunch
===========

CloudLaunch is a ReSTful, extensible Django app for discovering and launching
applications on cloud, container, or local infrastructure. A live version is
available at https://beta.launch.usegalaxy.org/.

CloudLaunch can be extended with your own plug-ins which can provide custom
launch logic for arbitrary custom applications. Visit the live site to see
currently available applications in the Catalog. CloudLaunch is also tightly
integrated with `CloudBridge <github.com/gvlproject/cloudbridge>`_, which makes
CloudLaunch natively multi-cloud.

CloudLaunch has a web and commandline front-end. The Web UI is maintained in the
`CloudLaunch-UI <https://github.com/galaxyproject/cloudlaunch-ui>`_ repository.
The commandline client is maintained in the
`cloudlaunch-cli <https://github.com/CloudVE/cloudlaunch-cli>`_ repository.

This is an all-new version of CloudLaunch that replaces the original
BioCloudCentral launcher. Code for that version is available in the
`BioCloudCentral branch <https://github.com/galaxyproject/cloudlaunch/tree/BioCloudCentral>`_.

Install Production Version
--------------------------

1. Install the cloudlaunch django server

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install cloudlaunch-server

Once installed, You can run django admin commands as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cloudlaunch-server django

2. Copy ``cloudlaunchserver/settings_local.py.sample`` to
   ``cloudlaunchserver/settings_local.py`` and make any desired configuration
   changes. **Make sure to change** the value for ``FERNET_KEYS`` variable
   because it is used to encrypt sensitive database fields.

3. Prepare the database with:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cloudlaunch-server django migrate
    $ cloudlaunch-server django createsuperuser
    $ cloudlaunch-server django runserver

4. Start the development server and celery task queue (along with a Redis
   server as the message broker), each process in its own tab.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python manage.py runserver
    $ redis-server & celery -A cloudlaunchserver worker -l info --beat

5. Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ to define your application and
   infrastructure properties.

6. Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/ to explore the API.

You will probably also want to install the UI for the server. The default UI
is available at https://github.com/galaxyproject/cloudlaunch-ui.

----------------------------

CloudLaunch is based on Python 3.6 and although it may work on older Python
versions, 3.6 is the only supported version. Use of virtualenv is also highly advised.

    $ mkdir launcher && cd launcher
    $ virtualenv venv -p python3.6 --prompt "(cloudlaunch)" && source venv/bin/activate
    $ git clone -b dev https://github.com/galaxyproject/cloudlaunch.git
    $ cd cloudlaunch
    $ python setup.py develop
    $ cd django-cloudlaunch
