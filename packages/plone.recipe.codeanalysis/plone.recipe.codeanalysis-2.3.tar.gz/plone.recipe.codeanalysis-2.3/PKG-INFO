        Introduction
        ============
        
        ``plone.recipe.codeanalysis`` provides static code analysis for Buildout-based
        Python projects, including `flake8`_, `JSHint`_, `CSS Lint`_, and
        other code checks.
        
        This buildout recipe creates a script to run the code analysis::
        
            bin/code-analysis
        
        By default ``plone.recipe.codeanalysis`` also creates a git pre-commit hook, in
        order to run the code analysis automatically before each commit.
        
        ``plone.recipe.codeanalysis`` comes with a Jenkins integration, that allows to
        use the same code analysis settings on your local machine as well as on
        Jenkins.
        
        It also allows to run code analysis to any arbitrary folder::
        
            bin/code-analysis src/Products.CMFPlone
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Just add a code-analysis section to your buildout.cfg:
        
        .. code-block:: ini
        
            [buildout]
            parts += code-analysis
        
            [code-analysis]
            recipe = plone.recipe.codeanalysis
            directory = ${buildout:directory}/src
        
        The directory option is not required. Though, if you don't specify a directory
        the code analysis will check every file in your buildout directory.
        
        This configuration is helpful for working on already existing packages.
        If you create a new package you might want to enable all checks.
        This configuration looks like this:
        
        .. code-block:: ini
        
            [code-analysis]
            recipe = plone.recipe.codeanalysis[recommended]
            multiprocessing = True
            jenkins = False
            directory =
                ${buildout:directory}/src
            pre-commit-hook = True
            # JS
            jshint = True
            jshint-bin = ${buildout:bin-directory}/jshint
            jshint-suppress-warnings = False
            jscs = True
            jscs-bin = ${buildout:bin-directory}/jscs
            jscs-exclude =
                ${buildout:directory}/dev/bower_components
                ${buildout:directory}/node_modules
            # CSS
            csslint = True
            csslint-bin = ${buildout:bin-directory}/csslint
            # ZPT
            zptlint = True
            zptlint-bin = ${buildout:bin-directory}/zptlint
            # TS
            tslint = True
            tslint-bin = ${buildout:directory}/bin/tslint
            tslint-exclude = ${:jscs-exclude}
            # Conventions
            clean-lines = True
            clean-lines-exclude = ${:jscs-exclude}
            # i18n
            find-untranslated = True
            i18ndude-bin = ${buildout:bin-directory}/i18ndude
            return-status-codes = True
            flake8-exclude = bootstrap.py,bootstrap-buildout.py,docs,*.egg,*.cpy,*.vpy,overrides
        
            [node]
            recipe = gp.recipe.node
            npms = csslint jshint jscs tslint
            scripts = csslint jshint jscs tslint
        
        ``[recommended]`` extra
        =======================
        
        This extra enables a host of flake8 plugins.
        They are mostly coding `Plone's styleguide`_ (specially the Python section).
        
        These are the current extras installed:
        
        - flake8-blind-except: warns about catching any exception, i.e ``except:``
        - flake8-coding: warns about python files with missing coding header
        - flake8-debugger: warns about debug statements found in code (like pdb...)
        - flake8-deprecated: warns about deprecated method calls
        - flake8-isort: warns about imports not sorted properly (note that an `extra configuration`_ is needed)
        - flake8-pep3101: warns about old-style formatting, i.e ``'format a %s' % string``
        - flake8-plone-api: warns about code that could be replaced by plone.api calls (note that this is forbidden for Plone core packages)
        - flake8-plone-hasattr: warns about using ``hasattr`` as it shallows exceptions
        - flake8-print: warns about ``print`` being used
        - flake8-quotes: warns about using double quotes (plone style guide says single quotes)
        - flake8-string-format: warns about errors on string formatting
        - flake8-todo: warns if there are ``TODO``, ``XXX`` found on the code
        - flake8-commas: warns if the last element on a method call, list or dictionary does not end with a comma
        
        Jenkins Installation
        ====================
        
        plone.recipe.codeanalysis provides a Jenkins setting that allows to run it on a Jenkins CI server and to process and integrate the output via the
        `Jenkins Violations plugin`_.
        
        Usually you don't want the recipe to create Jenkins output files on your
        local machine. Therefore it makes sense to enable the Jenkins output only
        on the CI machine. To do so, just create a jenkins.cfg that extends and
        overrides the default buildout file (that includes the other settings):
        
        .. code-block:: ini
        
            [buildout]
            parts += code-analysis
        
            [code-analysis]
            recipe = plone.recipe.codeanalysis
            jenkins = True
        
        The Jenkins job itself should run ``bin/code-analysis``::
        
            python bootstrap.py -c jenkins.cfg
            bin/buildout -c jenkins.cfg
            bin/jenkins-test --all
            bin/code-analysis
        
        The `Jenkins Violations plugin`_ needs to be configured to read the output
        files generated by this configuration.
        
        pep8 (to read the flake8 output)::
        
            **/parts/code-analysis/flake8.log
        
        csslint::
        
            **/parts/code-analysis/csslint.xml
        
        jslint (to read the jshint output)::
        
            **/parts/code-analysis/jshint.xml
        
        checkstyle (to read the jscs output)::
        
            **/parts/code-analysis/jscs.xml
        
        Filesystem output
        =================
        
        If jenkins is set to False, you can still store the output on the filesystem by setting ``flake8-filesystem = True``.
        This is ignored if jenkins is set to True.
        
        output::
        
            **/parts/code-analysis/flake8.txt

        Supported options
        =================
        
        If you need to bypass checks for some reasons on a specific line you may use
        ``# noqa`` in Python or ``// noqa`` in Javascript files. This works for most
        of our checks.
        
        The recipe supports the following options:
        
        **directory**
            Directory that is subject to the code analysis.
        
        **pre-commit-hook**
            If set to True, a git pre-commit hook is installed that runs the code
            analysis before each commit. Default is ``True``.
        
        **multiprocessing**
            If set to ``True``, ``code-analysis`` will fork multiple processes and run
            all linters in parallel. This will dramatically increase speed on a
            multi-core system, specially when using ``code-analysis`` as pre-commit
            hook. Default is ``False``.
        
        **jenkins**
            If set to True, the flake8, jshint and csslint code analysis steps will
            write output files that can be processed by the
            `Jenkins Violations plugin`_. Default is ``False``.
        
        **flake8-filesystem**
            If set to True, the flake8 code analysis step will
            write an output file. Ignored if jenkins is True. Default is ``False``.
        
        **flake8**
            If set to True, run Flake8 code analysis. Default is ``True``.
        
        **flake8-extensions**
            Flake8 now takes advantage of ``flake8`` extension system. Default is none.
            If ``flake8`` is set to False, this option will be ignored. Example to
            supercharge with some extensions:
        
        .. code-block:: ini
        
            [code-analysis]
            recipe = plone.recipe.codeanalysis
            flake8 = True
            flake8-extensions =
                flake8-blind-except
                flake8-coding
                flake8-debugger
                flake8-quotes
                pep8-naming
        
        All through flake8 extensions raised validation errors may be suppressed
        using the ``flake8-ignore`` option.
        
        **flake8-ignore**
            Skip errors or warnings. See `Flake8 documentation`_ for error codes.
            Default is none.
        
        **flake8-exclude**
            Comma-separated filename and glob patterns default. Say you want to
            exclude bootstrap.py, setup.py and all collective.* and plone.* packages.
            Just set ``flake8-exclude=bootstrap.py,docs,*.egg,setup.py,collective.*,plone.*``
            in your buildout configuration. Default is
            ``bootstrap.py,bootstrap-buildout.py,docs,*.egg``.
        
        **flake8-max-complexity**
            McCabe complexity threshold. Default is ``10``.
        
        **flake8-max-line-length**
            Set maximum allowed line length. Default is ``79``.
        
        .. note::
           You can add additional flake8 options as long as they are valid for flake8
           itself or any of its plugins. Just prefix them with ``flake8-``.
        
           For example, if you are using ``pep8-naming`` and want to change the list
           of ignored names, add the following line on your buildout.cfg:
           ``flake8-ignore-names = setUp,tearDown,setUpClass,tearDownClass``
        
           Look at flake8 documentation and its plugins to see which options are available.
        
        **check-manifest**
            If set to True, ``check-manifest`` will be run to check you MANIFEST.in
            file. Default is ``False``.
        
        **check-manifest-directory**
            Default is ``.`` which means check the current package where you included
            code-analysis in buildout.
        
            EXPERIMENTAL: For project buildouts where you use several source
            packages you may want to enter multiple directories or use
            ``${buildout:develop}`` to include all your development packages.
        
        **jshint**
            If set to True, jshint code analysis is run. Default is ``False``. Note
            that plone.recipe.codeanalysis requires jshint >= 1.0.
        
        **jshint-bin**
            JSHint executable. Default is ``jshint``. If you have JSHint installed on
            your system and in your path, there is nothing to do. To install JSHint in
            your buildout, use the following:
        
        .. code-block:: ini
        
            [jshint]
            recipe = gp.recipe.node
            npms = jshint
            scripts = jshint
        
        set jshint-bin to ``${buildout:bin-directory}/jshint``.
        
        **jshint-exclude**
            Allows you to specify directories which you don't want to be linted.
            Default is none. If you want JSHint to skip some files you can list them
            in a file named ``.jshintignore``. See `JSHint documentation`_ for more
            details.
        
        **jshint-suppress-warnings**
            By default warnings of jshint are suppressed and not shown. You may disable
            this by setting to False, default is ``True`` for backward compatibility
            reasons.
        
        **jscs**
            If set to True, jscs code analysis is run. Default is ``False``.
        
            JavaScript Code Style options should be configured using a ``.jscs.json``
            file. You should align your javascript code to the next generation of
            Plone's javascript framework Mockup_ and take it's ``.jscs.json`` file
            which is available here:
            https://github.com/plone/mockup/blob/master/mockup/.jscs.json
        
            All configuration options are documented on the `jscs website`_.
        
        **jscs-bin**
            Set the path to a custom version of JSCS, e.g. ``/usr/local/bin/jscs``.
        
            If you have Javascript Code Style Checker installed in your system and
            path, you have nothing to do. To install with Buildout, add the following
            section to your buildout and set jscs-bin to
            ``{buildout:bin-directory}/jscs``:
        
        .. code-block:: ini
        
            [jscs]
            recipe = gp.recipe.node
            npms = jscs
            scripts = jscs
        
        **jscs-exclude**
            Allows you to specify directories and/or files which you don't want to be
            checked. Default is none. Note that these directories have to be given in
            absolute paths, use ``${buildout:directory}/foo/bar/static/js-3rd-party``
            for example.
        
        **csslint**
            If set to True, CSS Lint code analysis is run. Default is ``False``.
        
            CSS Lint options should be configured using a ``.csslintrc`` file. A
            typical ``.csslintrc`` file will look like this::
        
                --format=compact
                --quiet
                --ignore=adjoining-classes,floats,font-faces,font-sizes,ids,qualified-headings,unique-headings
                --exclude-list=foo/bar/static/third-party.css
        
            This typical configuration includes a list of CSS rules that will be
            ignored as they are `considered useless`_.
        
            See `CSS Lint documentation`_ and `CSS Lint command-line interface`_ for a
            detailed list and description of the rules.
        
        **csslint-bin**
            Set the path to a custom version of CSS Lint, e.g. ``/usr/local/bin/csslint``.
        
            If you have CSS Lint installed in your system and path, you have nothing
            to do. To install CSS Lint with Buildout, add the following section to
            your buildout and set csslint-bin to
            ``{buildout:bin-directory}/csslint``:
        
        .. code-block:: ini
        
            [csslint]
            recipe = gp.recipe.node
            npms = csslint
            scripts = csslint
        
        **csslint-exclude**
            Allows you to specify directories and/or files which you don't want to be
            checked. Default is none.
        
        **clean-lines**
            If set to True, **any file** containing trailing spaces or tabs anywhere
            on the lines will cause a warning. Default is ``False``.
        
        **clean-lines-exclude**
            Allows you to specify directories and/or files which you don't want to be
            checked. Default is none.
        
        **return-status-codes**
            If set to True, the ``bin/code-analysis`` script returns an error code
            that Continuous Integration servers (like Travis CI) can use to fail or
            pass a job, based on the code analysis output. Note that Jenkins usually
            does not need this option (this is better handled by the Jenkins
            Violations plugin). Note that this option does not have any effect on the
            other code analysis scripts. Default is ``False``.
        
        i18ndude and zptlint support
        ----------------------------
        
        To reduce the number of Zope/Plone direct dependencies, plone.recipe.codeanalysis no longer depends on `i18ndude`_ nor `zptlint`_;
        in order to use the following options you have to install them on your

        Example usage
        =============
        
        Minimal buildout::
        
            >>> write('buildout.cfg',
            ... """
            ... [buildout]
            ... parts = code-analysis
            ...
            ... [code-analysis]
            ... recipe = plone.recipe.codeanalysis
            ... directory = %(directory)s
            ... """ % {
            ...     'directory' : '${buildout:directory}/plone/recipe/codeanalysis',
            ... })
        
        Running the buildout gives us a 'code-analysis' script that runs the entire
        code analysis::
        
            >>> buildout_output_lower = system(buildout).lower()
            >>> '/sample-buildout/bin/code-analysis' in buildout_output_lower
            True
        
        It is also possible to run single code analysis scripts::
        
            >>> '/sample-buildout/bin/code-analysis-flake8' in buildout_output_lower
            True
            >>> '/sample-buildout/bin/code-analysis-jshint' in buildout_output_lower
            True
        
        Flake 8 is installed by the buildout script, there is no need to install it on
        the system::
        
            >>> '/sample-buildout/bin/flake8' in buildout_output_lower
            True
        
        
        Pre-commit hook
        ===============
        
        If we have a git repository::
        
            >>> import subprocess
            >>> subprocess.call(['mkdir', '-p', '.git/hooks'])
            0
        
        And run buildout again::
        
            >>> buildout_output_lower = system(buildout).lower()
        
        Then the git pre-commit hook is installed::
        
            >>> 'install git pre-commit hook.' in buildout_output_lower
            True

        - Removed some plugins and replaced them with ``flake8`` plugins. Please
          not the API change in buildout. Following options have been removed:
        
          - **utf8-headers** has been removed, replace it with ``flake8-coding`` if
            needed.
          - **utf8-headers-exclude**
          - **prefer-single-quotes** has been removed, replace it with
            ``flake8-quotes``.
          - **prefer-single-quotes-exclude**
          - **debug-statements** has some reduced functionality, because python
            debugger checks should be included using ``flake8-debugger`` extension which
            also checks for ``ipdb``.
