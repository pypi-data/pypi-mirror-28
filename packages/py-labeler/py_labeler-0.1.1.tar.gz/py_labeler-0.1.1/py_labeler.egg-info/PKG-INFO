Description: py_labeler
        =================
        
        This project seeks to build a Python based GUI for manual labeling of
        candidate pairs.
        
        Given two tables A and B, the goal of
        EM is to discover the tuple pairs between two tables that refer to the
        same real-world entities. There are two main steps involved in entity matching:
        blocking and matching. The blocking step aims to remove obvious non-matching
        tuple pairs and reduce the set considered for matching. Entity matching in
        practice involves many steps than just blocking and matching. While performing EM
        users often execute many steps, e.g. exploring, cleaning, debugging, sampling,
        estimating accuracy, etc. Current EM systems however do not cover the entire
        EM pipeline, providing support only for a few steps (e.g., blocking, matching), while
        ignoring less well-known yet equally critical steps (e.g., debugging, sampling).
        py_entitymatching seeks to support all the steps involved in EM pipeline.
        
        At the matching step, users would want to check and verify candidate pairs as matches
        or non-matches. This is a manual process and this package py_labeler, provides a GUI to make this
        process easier.
        
        The package is free, open-source, and BSD-licensed.
