        ===============
        
        This program monitors a specified set of data streams (files) for
        changes. If a file is not changed in a specified time, an alert is sent
        using Pushbullet.
        
        setup
        =====
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            pip install stream_monitor
        
        Set up a Pushbullet account, create an access token and store a
        Pushbullet token in the file ``~/.pushbullet``. Install Pushbullet on a
        mobile device.

        configuration and usage
        =======================
        
        The file ``stream_monitor_configuration.py`` is imported as a module
        from the working directory. It contains a dictionary of the following
        form:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            streams = {
                "./recording.csv": {"update_time": 30}
            }
        
        When the script ``stream_monitor.py`` is executed, it imports the
        configuration and runs in a continuous loop, sending a Pushbullet alert
        whenever it detects that a stream is not being updated in its expected
        update time. The script has options for alarms and verbosity.
