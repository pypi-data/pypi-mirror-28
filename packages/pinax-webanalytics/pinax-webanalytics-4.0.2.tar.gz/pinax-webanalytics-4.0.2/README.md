    # other apps
    "pinax.webanalytics",
)
```

### Settings

#### PINAX_WEBANALYTICS_ADWORDS_SETTINGS

This sets the conversion identifiers for AdWords for the conversions
you want to track indexed by page specific keys:

```python
PINAX_WEBANALYTICS_ADWORDS_SETTINGS = {
    "waitinglist": {
        "conversion_id": "",
        "conversion_label": "",
        "conversion_format": ""
    }
}
```

#### PINAX_WEBANALYTICS_SETTINGS

This is a data structure defining your analytics and metrics settings
indexed by `settings.SITE_ID` (or `request.pwa_site_id`.) Example:

```python
PINAX_WEBANALYTICS_SETTINGS = {
    "mixpanel": {
        1: "", # production
        2: "", # beta
    },
    "google": {
        1: "", # production
        2: "", # beta
    },
    "gauges": {
        1: "",
    }
}
```

where the values you would supply for each service and `SITE_ID` (or
`request.pwa_site_id`) node is the identifier code for that service.

Note that, as of 1.1, the site ID keys *must* be integers, not strings.

### Templates

pinax-webanalytics ships with templates for three services out of the box, gaug.es, Google
Analytics and Mixpanel. This can be overridden in your project for customizations
and likewise if there are other services you wish to use, just create a similar
template under the `pinax-webanalytics` folder in your templates directory. The format is
``"_%s.html" % slug`` where the slug is what index the `PINAX_WEBANALYTICS_SETTINGS` dict with.

#### `_gauges.html`

This snippet is used for gaug.es

#### `_google.html`

This snippet is used for Google Analytics

#### `_mixpanel.html`

This snippet is used for Mixpanel

#### `_adwords_conversion.html`

This snippet is used by the `adwords_conversion` template tag

### Usage

Integrating `pinax-webanalytics` quite simple::

```
    {% load pinax_webanalytics_tags %}
```

and then toward the bottom of the body where you put your scripts:

```
    {% analytics %}
```

If you want to add certain specific activities you can use the activity
API in `pinax-webanalytics` like so:

```python
from pinax.webanalytics import activity

activity.add(request, "mixpanel", "track", "Node Viewed", {
    "node": self.get_object().title,
    "user": request.user.username
})
```

You would typically want to call this within a view where you had some
activity you wanted to track that was more transactional than could be
determined by simply a certain page view.

The parameters for this are the request, the kind, then the method that
is used on the kind's javascript API, followed by a list of args that
will be passed to that javascript API.

#### AdWords Conversion Tracking

Load the template tags as above:

```
    {% load pinax_webanalytics_tags %}
```

then toward the bottom of the body, include:

```
    {% adwords_conversion "waitinglist" %}
```

where the argument passed to `adwords_conversion` is the key used in
`PINAX_WEBANALYTICS_ADWORDS_SETTINGS` to provide the conversion id, label and
format.
