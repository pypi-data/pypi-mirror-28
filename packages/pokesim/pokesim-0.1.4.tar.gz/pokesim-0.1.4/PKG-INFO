        =======
        
        This package contains a playable pokemon battle simulation game.
        Currently supports only a small part of one Pokemon's moveset. Aims for
        Gen VII compatibility; future generations are not guaranteed to be
        playable. Also will not feature Mega Evolutions or Z-Moves for the
        forseeable future. Double, Triple, Rotation and other misc. battle types
        are a huge stretch goal, behind supporting multi-Pokemon teams.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        The easiest way to install is with ``pip``. If your pip installs for
        python 3.6+, simply enter
        
        ::
        
            pip install pokesim
        
        at the command line. To install manually, download this repo and run
        
        ::
        
            python setup.py install
