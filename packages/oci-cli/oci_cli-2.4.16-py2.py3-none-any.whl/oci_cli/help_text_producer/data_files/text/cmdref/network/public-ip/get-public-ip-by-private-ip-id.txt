get-public-ip-by-private-ip-id
******************************


Description
===========

Gets the public IP assigned to the specified private IP. You must
specify the OCID of the private IP. If no public IP is assigned, a 404
is returned.

**Note:** If you're fetching a reserved public IP that is in the
process of being moved to a different private IP, and you provide the
OCID of the original private IP, this operation returns a 404. If you
instead provide the OCID of the target private IP, or if you instead
call GetPublicIp or GetPublicIpByIpAddress, the service returns the
public IP object with *lifecycleState* = ASSIGNING and *privateIpId* =
OCID of the target private IP.
