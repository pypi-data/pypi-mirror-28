        ==========
        
        ``sneakysnek`` is a minimalistic, cross-platform global input capture
        solution for Python 3.6+. While there are certainly already offerings in
        terms of input libraries, they generally focus more on sending input,
        with capturing only being an afterthought. ``sneakysnek`` is dead simple
        in both its design and how you end up using it. You will be up and
        running in less than 5 lines of code and will start receiving lean &
        universal events on all 3 supported platforms (Linux, Windows, macOS).
        
        This library was built with the goal of powering the Gameplay Recording
        feature in the `Serpent.AI
        Framework <https://github.com/SerpentAI/SerpentAI>`__ where keyboard &
        mouse inputs are collected alongside frame sequences to build machine
        learning datasets.
        
        Feel free to study the code to learn more about input capturing and use
        it responsibly!

        Installation
        ------------
        
        ::
        
            pip install sneakysnek
        
        Zero dependencies on Windows. Will install ``pyobjc-framework-Quartz``
        on macOS and ``python-xlib`` on Linux.
        
        Demo
        ----
        
        Once installed in your Python environment, you can take it for a quick
        spin to test it on your platform.
        
        ::
        
            python -m sneakysnek.recorder
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Using ``sneakysnek`` is ridiculously simple:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            from sneakysnek.recorder import Recorder
        
            recorder = Recorder.record(print)  # Replace print with any callback that accepts an 'event' arg
            # Some blocking code in your main thread...
        
        ``sneakysnek`` runs its capturing and callbacks in separate threads. It
        should not leave anything behind in most cases. For optimal cleanliness,
        run ``recorder.stop()`` from your main thread when you are done
        recording.
        
        Events
        ------
        
        The callback you provide your recorder with will receive one of the
        following 2 event objects:
        
        KeyboardEvent
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Represents an event captured from the keyboard.
        
        **Attributes**
        
        -  *event*: One of ``KeyboardEvents.DOWN``, ``KeyboardEvents.UP``
        -  *keyboard_key*: One entry from the `KeyboardKey
           enumeration <https://github.com/SerpentAI/sneakysnek/blob/master/sneakysnek/keyboard_keys.py>`__
        -  *timestamp*: A ``time.time()`` timestamp
        
        MouseEvent
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Represents an event captured from the mouse.
        
        **Attributes**
        
        -  *event*: One of ``MouseEvents.CLICK``. ``MouseEvents.SCROLL``,
           ``MouseEvents.MOVE``
        -  *button*: One entry from the `MouseButton
           enumeration <https://github.com/SerpentAI/sneakysnek/blob/master/sneakysnek/mouse_buttons.py>`__
        -  *direction*: One of ``"DOWN"``, ``"UP"``
        -  *velocity*: An integer representing the velocity of scroll events
           (only >1 on macOS)
        -  *x*: An integer representing the x coordinate of the mouse position
        -  *y*: An integer representing the y coordinate of the mouse position
        -  *timestamp*: A ``time.time()`` timestamp
