## Usage
### In Flask

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config.from_object('config')
d = PgConfig(app.config['DBSCHEMA'], app.config['DBINIFILES'])

@app.before_request
def before_request():
    try:
        g.db = d.get_handle()
    except Exception as e:
        app.logger.exception(e)
        abort(503)

@app.teardown_request
def teardown_request(exception):
    db = getattr(g, 'db', None)
    if db is not None:
        db.close()

@app.route('/user/<int:userid>')
def index(userid):
    query = 'select * from table where id = %s'
    rows = pg_query(g.db, query, [userid], fetch_one=True)
```

## Configuration


## Information

1. I don't like ORMs
2. I don't like ad hoc queries in my application code
3. Unless it's a really simple SQL query, I obtain all data through database functions
4. So far, so good
