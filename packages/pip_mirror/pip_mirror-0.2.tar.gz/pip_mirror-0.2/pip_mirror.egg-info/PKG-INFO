Description: This application implements a PyPI mirror application
        according to PEP 381.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        It is possible to run this application directly from the source
        distribution. Alternatively, 'python setup.py install' could be used.
        
        The actual mirroring is performed by the pip_mirrorrun script, which
        should be invoked through cron like this::
        
           */15 *  *   *   *     /path/pip_mirror/pip_mirror -q /var/pypi
        
        The command line arguments points to root of the data files that
        the mirror creates. An initial run (without the -q option) should
        be performed manually. It is possible to interrupt the mirroring;
        it will automatically know where to continue when restarted.
        
        In above example, /var/pypi/web must be served through the webserver.
        An Apache configuration could read like this::
        
          <VirtualHost IPADDRESS:80>
            ServerName X.pypi.python.org
            CustomLog /var/log/apache2/pypi.log combined
            DocumentRoot /var/pypi/web
            SetEnv PYPITARGET /var/pypi
            ScriptAlias /sync /path/pip_mirrorsync.cgi
          </VirtualHost>
        
        Notice that supporting the sync URL requires that the web server
        user has access to the mirror data, or else that the CGI script
        runs as the mirror user.
        
        To propagate the download statistics back to the central server,
        processlogs must be run regularly, e.g. through::
        
           10 7  *   *   *     /path/pip_mirror/processlogs /var/pypi /var/log/apache2/pypi.log{,.1}
