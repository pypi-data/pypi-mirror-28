Description: # dat_struct_py
        Basic Data Structures and Operations Implemented in Python
        ## Installation Instructions
        - Python 3.5 is currently supported
        - Install from PyPI using
           - pip install dat_struct_py
        
        ## Supported Data Structures
         - Singly Linked List
         - Doubly Linked List
         - Circularly Singly Linked List  
         - Stack using Linked List
        
        ### Operations Supported for Linked Lists
          - Create a linked list through input sequence or inserts
            - At the beginning
            - At the end
            - At any Position
          - Delete a node carrying some value
          - Size
          - Print
          - Quick check whether the list has even length
          - Return nth element from the end
          - Quick check whether a cycle exists
          - Return cycle length(if one exists)
          - Reverse in Place
          - Swap Pairs - Works only for Even length linked list
        
        ### Operations Supported for Stacks
          - Create a stack by pushing elements one by one or through an input sequence
          - Check whether the stack is empty
          - Check whether the stack is full
          - Push an element
          - Pop an element
          - Peek the top element
          - Check balanced symbols
