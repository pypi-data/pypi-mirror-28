        Parse ward lists from Electoral Change Orders on
        http://www.legislation.gov.uk/
        
        What does this package do?
        --------------------------
        
        This package solves a very specific problem.
        
        Local Government electoral divisions/wards in the UK are defined by a
        piece of legislation called an Electoral Change Order. An Electoral
        Change Order (ECO) always comes into force the day before the first
        election which is held using the boundaries it defines. Once this first
        election has happened, details of the new divisions are fairly easy to
        get hold of. They are published as machine-readable structured data by
        organisations like `Ordnance
        Survey <https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-and-government/products/boundary-line.html>`__
        and the `Office for National
        Statistics <http://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/>`__. If you need
        information about divisions that have already been used for one or more
        elections, use one of these sources. In that situation, this tool is
        probably the least useful route to the information you want.
        
        In the case where we need to talk about local electoral divisions which
        have been defined by an ECO but which have not yet been used in an
        election (i.e: the ECO has been made, but has not yet come into force),
        the only source for the division names is the ECO legislation itself.
        
        This package provides some routines to help with parsing ward and
        division names from the
        `legislation.gov.uk <http://www.legislation.gov.uk/>`__'s `XML
        API <http://www.legislation.gov.uk/developer/contents>`__ outputs (which
        are semi-structured). It is early days, so there are probably going to
        be some formats we don't support yet. If you find one in new or recent
        legislation, `raise an
        issue <https://github.com/DemocracyClub/eco-parser/issues>`__.
        
        TL;DR
        ~~~~~
        
        If you need the official names of electoral divisions that are already
        in use, get the data from `OS Boundary
        Line <https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-and-government/products/boundary-line.html>`__,
        `ONS Geography <http://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/>`__ or a web service
        like `mapit <https://mapit.mysociety.org/>`__. This information is
        already published as convenient machine-readable structured data.
        
        If you need the official names of electoral divisions that are not in
        use yet, this package may be able to help you parse them from
        legislation.
