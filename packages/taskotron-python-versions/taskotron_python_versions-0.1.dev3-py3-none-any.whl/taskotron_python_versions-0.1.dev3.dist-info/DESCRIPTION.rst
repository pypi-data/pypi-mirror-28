`Taskotron <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Taskotron>`__ task regarding Python versions
=======================================================================================

This represents the automatic checks happening in the Fedora
infrastructure after any package is built.

Currently the following checks are available:

-  Whether a package does not require Python 2 and Python 3 at the same
   time;

-  Whether the package name follows the Python package naming scheme;

-  Whether the package uses versioned Python prefix in requirements' names;

-  Whether only Python 2 version of the package contains the executables;

-  Whether the package uses versioned shebangs in its executables;

-  Whether the package supports Python 3 upstream but not in the package.


Running
-------

You can run the checks locally with
`Taskotron <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Taskotron>`__. First,
install it (you can
follow the
`Quickstart <https://qa.fedoraproject.org/docs/libtaskotron/latest/quickstart.html>`__).
You'll also need the ``rpm``, ``dnf`` and ``libarchive-c`` Python 2 modules
(``python2-rpm``, ``python2-dnf``, ``python2-libarchive-c``).
Note that Taskotron unfortunately runs on Python 2, but the code in
this repository is Python 3 compatible as well.

Once everything is installed you can run the task on a Koji build
using the
``name-(epoch:)version-release`` (``nevr``) identifier.

.. code:: console

    $ runtask -i <nevr> -t koji_build runtask.yml

For example:

.. code:: console

    $ runtask -i eric-6.1.6-2.fc25 -t koji_build runtask.yml

Tests
-----

There are also automatic tests available. You can run them using
`tox <https://tox.readthedocs.io/>`__.
You'll need the above mentioned dependencies and ``python3-rpm``
and ``python3-dnf`` installed as well.

.. code:: console

    $ tox

Automatic tests also happen on `Tarvis
CI <https://travis-ci.org/fedora-python/taskotron-python-versions/>`__.
Since Travis CI runs on Ubuntu
and Ubuntu lacks the RPM Python bindings and Taskotron,
`Docker <https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/docker/>`__ is used
to run the tests on Fedora. You can run the tests in Docker as well,
just use the commands from the ``.travis.yml`` file.
