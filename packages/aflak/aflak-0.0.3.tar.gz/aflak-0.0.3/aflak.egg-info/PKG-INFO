        .. figure:: https://api.travis-ci.org/malikolivier/aflak.svg?branch=master
           :alt: Build status
        
        Environment
        ===========
        
        Support Python3.
        
        Setup
        =====
        
        ::
        
            virtualenv -p python3 venv
            . ./venv/bin/activate
            pip install -r requirements.txt
        
        Open a FITS file
        ================
        
        ::
        
            ./run my-fits-file.fits
        
        The provided FITS file is required to have the following extensions:
        
        - 'FLUX': 3D data containing 2D luminosity component for each wavelength value
        - 'WAVE': 1D data containing value of each target wavelength
        
        After some fiddling you should be able to get a window like below:
        
        .. figure:: images/2017-11-13-screenshot.jpg?raw=true
           :alt: Screen capture of the running GUI application
        
        Get sample FITS files
        =====================
        
        The Makefile contains a few recipes to get sample fits files.
        Run make as below:
        
        ::
        
            make data/manga-7443-12703-LINCUBE.fits
        
        To see a fits file header
        =========================
        
        ::
        
            fold -w 80 foo.fits | less
        
        TODO
        ====
        
        -  Show arbitrary sums over spectral data (currently only show one frame)
        -  Benchmark / Test with several fits files
        -  Improve ROI drawing
        -  Include GUI way of showing a fits header
        -  Set a label on the histogram's Y-axis (flux [1E-17 erg/s/cm^2])
        -  Add a compass showing North and East directions and a scale bar in the unit
           of arcsec on the image
        
        v0.0.3
        ======
        
        Fix: Run aflak as module (with `python -m aflak`)
        
        New:
        
        - Include some unit tests
        - Include units in waveform axes, read from loaded FITS files
        
        
        v0.0.2
        ======
        
        Fix: Use logarithmic scale on brightness histograms
        
        
        v0.0.1
        ======
        
        Very first version released on PyPI. Can only open FITS files and visualize
        FLUX and WAVE data.
