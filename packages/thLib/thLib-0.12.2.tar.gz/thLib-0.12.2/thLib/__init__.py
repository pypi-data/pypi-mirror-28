"thLib" primarily contains functions for working with 3D kinematics. (i.e.
quaternions and rotation matrices). In addition, it has a number of routines
for fitting circles, lines, sine-waves, and exponential decays. For signal
processing, a Savitzky-Golay filter is included, as well as a demonstration of
the calculation of a power spectrum. UI utilities, and a few useful vector
functions (e.g. an implementation of the Savitzky-Golay algorithm) round off
"thLib".

Compatible with Python 2 and 3.
