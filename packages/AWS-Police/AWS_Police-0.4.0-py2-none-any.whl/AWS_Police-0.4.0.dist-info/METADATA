Development of this tool is still in progress. Currently you can view your running instances in a single run. This program will search in all regions for ec2 instances. You have to create a user with programatic access and attach a role with full access to ec2. Configure aws credentials in your environment by running aws configure command in your CLI. If you want to delete all the instances that also you can perform easily without going to the never loading aws dashboard.
