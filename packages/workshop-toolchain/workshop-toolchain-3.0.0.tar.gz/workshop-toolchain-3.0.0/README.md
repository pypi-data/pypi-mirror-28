## üìÑ Usage

#### AFTER THE INSTALLATION: 
**1.** You have to execute `gf config` and provide your GitHub credentials.
Choose your language **WITHOUT** using quote. Then write `y`, if you are in the
correct directory. 
It will create a GitHub token and store it under `.gf/` folder **in**
your home directory.

##### !FOR WINDOWS USERS!
Users should execute `gf config` either in windows CMD **OR** 
should execute `winpty gf config`.

**2.** Then you will have to initialize the day by executing `gf start <workshop_name>`.
It will download the exercises for that day into the current directory. 
**One folder represents one day** so you can only use this command 
**ONCE** in a folder. 
*Workshop_name* is the name to the current workshop's language specified markdown file.

**3.** After you have downloaded your daily workshop you should execute 
`gf open` to open the actual workshop in a new browser tab. 

**4.** Before you verify the selected exercise, please execute `gf lint <filename>` to check 
the clean code.

**5.** When you have *the solution* for an exercise you can verify it by the 
`gf verify <filename>` command.

**6.** You can rate an exercise between `1` to `5` by the `gf rate <filename>` command.
