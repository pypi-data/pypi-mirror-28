        Introduction
        ============
        
        What is yamgl_gen?
        ------------------
        
        **yamgl_gen** is a generator used for producing compile time object data 
        for the yamgl library.
        
        How is yamgl_gen licensed?
        --------------------------
        
        `BSD license <https://github.com/iocapa/yamgl_gen/blob/master/LICENSE>`_.
        
        Contact details
        ---------------
        
        For reporting problems with **yamgl_gen** or submitting feature requests, please
        open an `issue <https://github.com/iocapa/yamgl_gen/issues>`_, or submit a
        pull request.
        
        Installing
        ==========
        
        Prerequisites
        -------------
        
        * **yamgl_gen** was tested on Python 3.6, on Windows. 
          Compatibility with older version is not guaranteed.
        
        * **yamgl_gen** has the following dependencies:
        
         * `lxml <https://github.com/lxml/lxml>`_
        
         * `freetype <https://github.com/rougier/freetype-py>`_ 
        
         * `Pillow <https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow>`_ 
        
        Installation process
        --------------------
        
        Installing **yamgl_gen** is very simple. Once you download and unzip the
        package, you just have to execute the standard ``python setup.py install``. The
        setup script will then place the ``yamgl_gen`` module into ``site-packages`` in
        your Python's installation library.
        
        Alternatively, since **yamgl_gen** is listed in the `Python Package Index
        <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/yamgl_gen>`_ (PyPI), you can install it using your
        favorite Python packaging/distribution tool, for example with::
        
            > pip install yamgl_gen
        
        Using
        =====
        
        Usage rationale
        ---------------
        
        yamgl_gen parses a given xlm file that must comply with the following `schema
        <https://github.com/iocapa/yamgl_gen/blob/master/yamgl_gen/schema.xsd>`_ , the 
        xml file contains all the objects that generate data.
        
        Usage scenario
        --------------
        
        A sample `xml <https://github.com/iocapa/yamgl_gen/blob/master/examples/example.xml>`_ 
        file is given inside the examples folder. The file contains generation instructions 
        for some fonts and a image. The fonts and the image are not part of this release due 
        to legal reasons.
        
        The application will generate a pair of source files (a source and a header). The 
        command line syntax is better detailed by running::
            
            > python yamgl_gen --help
        
        Package contents
        ================
