Description: Release Exporter
        ================
        
        Exports your releases to a markdown based on `keep a
        changelog <http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/>`__ and
        `markdownlint <https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint>`__. This CLI
        application currently supports GitHub and GitLab.
        
        Install
        -------
        
        .. code:: cmd
        
            pip install release-exporter
        
        Or download this repository and type in the following in your
        terminal/cmd
        
        .. code:: cmd
        
            python setup.py install
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        In your terminal/cmd, change to the folder where you repository is
        located and do the following:
        
        .. code:: cmd
        
            rex --token <your token> markdown
        
        That's it. You should see a ``CHANGELOG.md`` in your folder.
        
        Advance Usage
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Release exporter has the following options
        
        .. code:: cmd
        
            Usage: rex [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...
        
            Options:
              --token TEXT     Token number if its a private repository.
              --url TEXT       URL of your repository. This is optional if your current
                               directory has .git folder with remote url.
              --location TEXT  Local location of your repository.
              --version
              --help           Show this message and exit.
        
            Commands:
              json      Creates JSON file.
              markdown  Creates markdown file.
        
        If you don't have a repository on your computer but you still want to
        generate a change log you can manually add your repository URL as
        following:
        
        .. code:: cmd
        
            rex markdown --token <your token> --url <your url>
        
        if you want to save it in a custom location you can use
        ``--location <location>``.
        
        You can also export your releases to JSON file by just replacing
        ``markdown`` with ``json``.
