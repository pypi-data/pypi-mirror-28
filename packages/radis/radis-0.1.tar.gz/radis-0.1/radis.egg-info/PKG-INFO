Description: RADIS
        =====
        
        A code to simulate infrared spectra of molecules.
        
        --------------
        
        RADIS is nonequilibrium emission and absorption line-by-line code, for
        use by infrared spectroscopic that want to compare line databases, or
        experimentalist that want to fit their experimental line-of-sight
        spectra.
        
        Written as a general purpose radiative solver, the code is built around
        the HITRAN, HITEMP and CDSD databases for molecules in their electronic
        ground state. Energy levels are read from tabulated databases or
        calculated from Dunham developments. Boltzmann, Treanor, and state
        specific vibrational distributions can be generated. A modular
        architecture makes it possible to add new species without modifications
        to the core code. Thus far, CO2, CO are featured for non-equilibrium
        calculations, and all species present in the HITRAN database are
        featured for equilibrium calculations. To fit experimental spectra,
        RADIS includes a line survey tool, an interface with a look-up database
        to improve fitting convergence times, and a multi-slab module with a
        radiative transfer equation solver to reproduce line-of-sight
        experiments. Validation cases against existing spectral codes and
        experimental results from various plasma sources are presented.
        
        The code will soon be available on this repository under under GNU
        General Public License v3.0
