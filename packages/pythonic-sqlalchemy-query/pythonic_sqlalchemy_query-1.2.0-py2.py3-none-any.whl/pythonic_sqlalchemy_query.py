#
# QueryMaker
# ==========
# This class provides a concise, Pythonic syntax for simple queries; for example, ``session.User['jack'].addresses`` produces a Query_ for the Address of a User named jack.
#
# This class provides the following methods:
#
# - Constructor: ``session.User`` (with help from QueryMakerSession_) creates a query on a User table.
# - Indexing: ``session.User['jack']`` performs filtering.
# - Attributes: ``session.User['jack'].addresses`` joins to the Addresses table.
# - Iteration: ``for x in session.User['jack'].addresses`` iterates over the results of the query.
# - Query access: ``User['jack'].addresses.q`` returns a Query-like object. Any Query_ method can be invoked on it.
#
# See the `demonstration and unit tests` for examples and some less-used methods.
#
# This works by translating class instances in a query/select, indexes into filters, and columns/relationships into joins. The following code shows the Pythonic syntax on the first line, followed by the resulting translation into SQLAlchemy performed by this class on the next line.
