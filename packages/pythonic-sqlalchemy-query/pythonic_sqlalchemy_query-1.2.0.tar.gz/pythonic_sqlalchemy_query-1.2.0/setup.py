# To package
# ==========
# Create a source distribution, a built distribution, then upload both to
# `pythonic_sqlalchemy_query at PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pythonic_sqlalchemy_query>`_::
#
#   python -m pip install -U pip setuptools wheel twine
#   python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
#   python -m twine upload dist/*
#
# For `development
# <https://pythonhosted.org/setuptools/setuptools.html#development-mode>`_:
#
#  ``pip install -e .``
#
# Packaging script
# ================
# Otherwise known as the evils of ``setup.py``.
#
# PyPA copied code
# ----------------
# From `PyPA's sample setup.py
# <https://github.com/pypa/sampleproject/blob/master/setup.py>`__,
# read ``long_description`` from a file. This code was last updated on
# 26-May-2015 based on `this commit
# <https://github.com/pypa/sampleproject/commit/4687e26c8a61e72ae401ec94fc1e5c0e17465b73>`_.
