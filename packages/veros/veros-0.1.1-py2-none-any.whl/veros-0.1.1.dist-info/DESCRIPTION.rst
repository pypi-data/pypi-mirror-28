Veros, the *versatile ocean simulator*, is just that: A powerful tool that makes high-performance ocean modeling approachable and fun. Since it is a pure Python module, the days of struggling with complicated model setup workflows, ancient programming environments, and obscure legacy code are finally over.

Veros supports both a NumPy backend for small-scale problems and a fully parallelized high-performance backend [powered by Bohrium](https://github.com/bh107/bohrium) using either OpenMP (CPU) or OpenCL (GPU). The underlying numerics are based on [pyOM2](https://wiki.cen.uni-hamburg.de/ifm/TO/pyOM2), an ocean model developed by Carsten Eden (Institut f√ºr Meereskunde, Hamburg University).
A good starting point to gain an overview of Veros' design, performance, and capabilities are [these slides of a talk on Veros](http://slides.com/dionhaefner/veros-ams) held during the 98th Annual Meeting of the American Meteorological Society.

Veros is currently being developed at Niels Bohr Institute, Copenhagen University.

## Features

Veros provides

-   a fully staggered **3-D grid geometry** (*C-grid*)
-   support for both **idealized and realistic configurations** in Cartesian or pseudo-spherical coordinates
-   several **friction and advection schemes** to choose from
-   isoneutral mixing, eddy-kinetic energy, turbulent kinetic energy, and internal wave energy **parameterizations**
-   several **pre-implemented diagnostics** such as energy fluxes, variable time averages, and a vertical overturning stream function (written to netCDF output)
-   **pre-configured idealized and realistic set-ups** that are ready to run and easy to adapt
-   **accessibility, readability, and extensibility** - thanks to the power of Python!

## Veros for the impatient

A minimal example to install and run Veros:

    $ pip install veros[all]
    $ veros copy-setup acc --to /tmp
    $ cd /tmp/acc
    $ python acc.py


## Installation

### Dependencies

Currently, the only officially supported Python version for Veros is Python 2.7 (64-bit), which should be the standard Python interpreter on most systems.

Veros only has two external library dependencies, namely `HDF5` and `netCDF`. The installation procedure of those libraries varies between platforms. Probably the easiest way to install Veros and its dependencies (includung Bohrium) is [Anaconda Python](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) that ships with a package manager (``conda``).

If you do not want to use Anaconda, the most convenient way is to use your operating system's package manager. On Debian / Ubuntu, you can e.g. use

    $ sudo apt-get install libhdf5-dev libnetcdf-dev

Similar package managers on OSX are [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) or [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/), which both provide the required dependencies as pre-compiled binaries.

### Installing Veros

As soon as you have a working environment, installing Veros is simple:

1.  Clone the repository to your hard-drive:

        $ git clone https://github.com/dionhaefner/veros.git

2.  Install it, preferably with

        $ pip install -e veros

    If you use the `-e` flag, any changes you make to the model code are immediately reflected without having to re-install.

In case you want to use the Bohrium backend, you will have to install [Bohrium](https://github.com/bh107/bohrium), e.g. through `conda` or `apt-get`, or by building it from source.

## Basic usage

To run Veros, you need to set up a model - i.e., specify which settings and model domain you want to use. This is done by subclassing the ``Veros`` base class in a *setup script* that is written in Python. You should have a look at the pre-implemented model setups in the repository's ``setup`` folder, or use the ``veros copy-setup`` command to copy one into your current folder. A good place to start is the [``ACC`` model](https://github.com/dionhaefner/veros/blob/master/setup/acc/acc.py).

After setting up your model, all you need to do is call the ``setup`` and ``run`` methods on your setup class. The pre-implemented setups can all be executed as scripts, e.g. through

    $ python acc.py

## Contributing

Contributions to Veros are always welcome, no matter if you spotted an inaccuracy in [the documentation](http://veros.readthedocs.io), wrote a nice setup, fixed a bug, or even extended Veros' core mechanics. There are two ways to contribute:

-   If you want to report a bug or request a missing feature, please [open an issue](https://github.com/dionhaefner/veros/issues). If you are reporting a bug, make sure to include all relevant information for reproducing it (ideally through a *minimal* code sample).
-   If you want to fix the issue yourself, or wrote an extension for Veros - great! You are welcome to submit your code for review by committing it to a repository and opening a [pull request](https://github.com/dionhaefner/veros/pulls). However, before you do so, please check [the contribution guide](http://veros.readthedocs.io/quickstart/get-started.html#enhancing-veros) for some tips on testing and benchmarking, and to make sure that your modifications adhere with our style policies. Most importantly, please ensure that you follow the [PEP8 guidelines](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/), use *meaningful* variable names, and document your code using [Google-style docstrings](http://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html).
