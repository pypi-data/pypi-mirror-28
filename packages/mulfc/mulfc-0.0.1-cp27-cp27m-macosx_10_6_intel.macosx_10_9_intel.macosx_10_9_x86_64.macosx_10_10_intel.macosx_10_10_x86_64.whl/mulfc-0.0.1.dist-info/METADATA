Description: Local Field Components
        ======================
        
        LFC is a small library to facilitate the evaluation of the local field at the muon site. 
        
        
        Install
        -------
        
        The LFC C library has no dependencies. CMake is used as a building tool.
        Any C90 compiler can be used to build the library.
        The details for the Python package follows.
        
        ### Prerequisites
        
        The python extension has the following dependencies:
        
        * Python 2.7, 3.1+      (http://www.python.org)
        * Numpy 1.6.0+          (http://www.numpy.org)
        
        
        ### Installation
        
        The easiest way to install the Python extension is using pre-baked
        wheels with pip:
        
            pip install mulfc
        
        ### Compilation
        
        You may want to build the extension yourself, especially for optimizing performances.
        
        To compile and install the C library just do
        
        ```bash
        mkdir build
        cd build
        cmake ..
        make
        make install
        ```
        
        To install the python extension you can do
        
        ```bash
        cd python
        python setup.py build
        python setup.py test
        python setup.py install
        ```
        
        The library and the python extension are independent from each other.
        
        Usage
