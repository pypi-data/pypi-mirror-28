Description: LiMMBo
        ======
        
        LiMMBo enables multivariate analysis of high-dimensional phenotypes
        based on linear mixed models with bootstrapping (LiMMBo). LiMMBo is
        available as an open source Python module. It builds on and can be used
        in combination with `Limix <https://github.com/limix/limix>`__, a
        flexible and efficient linear mixed model library with interfaces to
        Python.
        
        A description of the public interface can be found
        `here <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/~hannah/limmbo/index.html>`__
        
        Install
        -------
        
        LiMMBo is currently available on the `Python Package
        Index <https://pypi.python.org>`__ and will in the future be available
        through (conda-forge[(https://conda-forge.org/#about]. The latter
        platform provides the recommended installation of
        `Limix <https://github.com/limix/limix>`__, which LiMMBo heavily relies
        on.
        
        The recommended way of installing both packages is the following:
        Install LIMIX via `conda <http://conda.pydata.org/docs/index.html>`__
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            conda install -c conda-forge limix
        
        After successful installation of LIMIX, simply install LiMMBo via
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            pip install limmbo
