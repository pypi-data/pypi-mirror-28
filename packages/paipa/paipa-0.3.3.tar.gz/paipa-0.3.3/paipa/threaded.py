"""
paipa - the threaded pipelining framework

What it does:

 - process stuff one step at a time
 - allows class based and function based steps
 - can scale steps independent of each other (manually)
 - don't do deadlocks
 - never expose the developer to the concept of a thread
   (if she doesn't like to)
 - run in finite batches where all threads are terminated at the end
 - run in continuous mode while being fed through a queue
 - automatically rate limit each step to minimize memory usage
 - terminate the pipeline in case of an Exception and propagate the error
   to the developer

What it explicitly doesn't do (if it doesn't, it's not a bug!):

 - pipelines with multiple different parents. Multiple parents of
   the same type are handled automatically though.
 - auto-scale threads
 - bake bread

What it shouldn't do (if it does, it's a bug!):

 - confuse the user/developer
 - hang on termination
 - hog resources

    """
    Abstract threaded pipeline step.

    Subclass this class to create your own threaded pipeline step.

    How to use it
    -------------

    A concrete step has to inherit from this AbstractStep. The pipeline gets a
    list of step classes (or factories) with concurrency and option info as
    input, instantiates them and connects them using queues.

    Your step MUST provide a `process` method, which gets fed a single item
    from the input queue and is expected to return a resulting item, which
    then is put into the output queue.

    Override the following hook methods for customization:

    ``step_initialize``
        Called once per step, after the first step-thread instance has been
        created.

    ``initialize``
        Called once per thread, after the thread instance has been created.
        Called after ``step_initialize``.

    ``thread_initialize``
        Called once per thread, after the threat has begun running.

    ``thread_shutdown``
        Called once per thread after a step-thread has been finished
        processing right before it's shut down

    ``step_shutdown``
        Called once per step after the last step-thread has been finished
        processing, right before it's shut down. Called after thread_shutdown

    ``in_queue_empty``
        Called every time when we want an item from the in-queue and it's
        empty

    ``_pass_on``
        Only override when needed. The method is responsible for passing stuff
        down to the output queue.

    ``_loop``
        Only override when needed. This is the main thread loop. This one
        actually gets an item from the in-queue passes it to process() and
        puts the result into the out-queue.


    :IVariables:
      `_counter` : counter
        Counter object

      `threshold` : ``int``
