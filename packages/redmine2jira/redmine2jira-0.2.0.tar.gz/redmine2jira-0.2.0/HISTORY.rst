0.2.0 (2018-01-19)
------------------

Improvements
************

* Added PyCharm IDE configuration and Python Virtual Environments to .gitignore
* Added configuration file with defaults and support for local configuration file
* Minor documentation fixes

Changes
*******

* Dropped out "Redmine XLS Plugin" in favor of Redmine REST API.

  Since the files exported by the plugin lack some information needed to produce files compatible with the Jira Importer Plugin (JIM),
  several calls to the Redmine REST API were needed to compensate the data. Hence to avoid the effort to merge the data coming from
  two difference sources I decided to rely solely on Redmine REST API to fetch all the needed data.
  
  This is a major project scope change that implied, in turn, the following modifications:

  - Renamed GitHub repository from "redmine-xls-export2jira" to "redmine2jira"
  - Renamed Python package from "redmine_xls_export2jira" to "redmine2jira"
  - Rename project description to "Redmine to JIRA Importers plugin"

  Any other reference to the "Redmine XLS Export" plugin has also been removed from the documentation.

* Removed Python 2.7 compatibility. Added Python 3.6 compatibility.
* Temporarily disable CLI tests
