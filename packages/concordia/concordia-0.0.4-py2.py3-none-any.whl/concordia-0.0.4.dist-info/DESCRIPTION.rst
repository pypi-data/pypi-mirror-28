Concordia- WIP
==============

|Build Status| |Coverage Status| |License|

Concordia is under active development right now, and aims to be a part
of a suite of open-source machine learning packages that allow
organizations to more rapidly develop and deploy machine learning
models.

Installation
------------

``pip install concordia``

Description
-----------

Using Concordia, you should be able to rapidly have confidence in your
shipped ML models.

If everything's working as expected, you should be able to see that, and
heave a sigh of relief.

If things are not going according to plan, again, you should be able to
see that rapidly, and nearly as quickly see the root cause of those
discrepancies.

It's designed to work across environments, with many critical parameters
configurable (such as database settings). |Analytics|
