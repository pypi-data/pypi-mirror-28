Concordia
=========

|Build Status| |License|

Using Concordia, you should be able to rapidly have confidence in your
shipped ML models.

If everything's working as expected, you should be able to see that, and
heave a sigh of relief.

If things are not going according to plan, again, you should be able to
see that rapidly, and nearly as quickly see the root cause of those
discrepancies.

It's designed to work across environments, with many critical parameters
configurable (such as database settings). |Analytics|
