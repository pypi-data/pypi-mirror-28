        ==============

        Concordia is under active development right now, and aims to be a part
        of a suite of open-source machine learning packages that allow
        organizations to more rapidly develop and deploy machine learning
        models.
        
        Using Concordia, you should be able to rapidly have confidence in your
        shipped ML models.
        
        If everything's working as expected, you should be able to see that, and
        heave a sigh of relief.
        
        If things are not going according to plan, again, you should be able to
        see that rapidly, and nearly as quickly see the root cause of those
        discrepancies.
        
        It's designed to work across environments, with many critical parameters
        configurable (such as database settings). |Analytics|
