Scanpy â€“ Single-Cell Analysis in Python
=======================================

Scanpy is a scalable toolkit for analyzing single-cell gene expression data. It includes preprocessing, visualization, clustering, pseudotime and trajectory inference, differential expression testing and simulation of gene regulatory networks. The Python-based implementation efficiently deals with datasets of more than one million cells.
