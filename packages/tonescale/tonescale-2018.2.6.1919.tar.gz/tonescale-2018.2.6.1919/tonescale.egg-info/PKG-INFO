        usage
        =====
        
        Tonescale provides various sound utilities and capabilities for Python
        in Linux. It provides a ``Sound`` class that can store a sound in a
        NumPy array, can load the sound from a file, can save the sound to a
        file, and can play the sound using ``aplay`` or by streaming the sound
        using PyAudio. Sounds can be added, summed and repeated symbolically.
        Tonescale includes some sounds.
        
        A tonescale module sound can be accessed in the following way:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            sound_1 = tonescale.access_sound(name = "199935__drzhnn__04-blip")
        
        Sounds can be repeated:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            sound_1.repeat(number = 2)
        
        Sounds can be added:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            sound_3 = sound_1 + sound_2
        
        Sounds can be summed:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            sound_3 = sum([sound_1, sound_2])
        
        Sounds can be played:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            sound_1.play()
        
        Sounds can be played in the background too:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            sound_1.play(background = True)
        
        Sounds can also be played in a stream:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            sound_1.play_stream()
        
        Sounds can be saved to files:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            sound_1.save_WAVE()
        
        Sounds can be loaded from files:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            sound_1.read_WAVE(filename = "199935__drzhnn__04-blip.wav")
        
        See example code for more details.
        
        Tonescale also provides ``sound_search.py``, which can search
        recursively for sound files of a specified minimum duration.
