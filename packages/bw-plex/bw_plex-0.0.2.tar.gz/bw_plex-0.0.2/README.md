```

The most common will be:
```bw_plex watch```

## How it works:

bw_plex will connect to PMS using websocket and listen for any playing events.
It will then download the theme and the first 10 minutes of the episode and try to figure out when the theme starts and ends. The result is stored in a sqlite db.
This process is rather slow so the first episode might get skipped. The next episode will be queued up so its ready when you start to watch it.
bw_plex will then seek the client to where the theme ended in that episode.
