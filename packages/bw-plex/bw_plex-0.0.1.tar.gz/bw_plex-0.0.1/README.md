# bw_plex
binge watching for plex

## Install
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage
bw_plex only works on python 2. :(

1. Download all the themes from pms using `plex_jump.py update_all_themes`
2. Create audiofingerprints of the themes so the videos can be matched against something. `plex_jump.py create_hash_table_from_themes`
3. Start using `plex_jump.py watch`

```
Usage: plex_jump.py [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  CLI tool that monitors and jumps the client to after the theme.

Options:
  -d, --debug            Add debug logging.
  -u, --username TEXT    Your plex username
  -p, --password TEXT    Your plex password
  -s, --servername TEXT  The server you want to monitor.
  --url TEXT             url to the server you want to monitor
  -t, --token TEXT       plex-x-token
  -c, --config TEXT      Not in use atm.
  --help                 Show this message and exit.

  match                          Manual match for a file.
  test_dexter                    Test manual process_to_db.
  update_all_themes              Find and download all themes
  watch                          Start watching the server for stuff to do.
```

bw_plex will work without step 1 and 2, but it will be much slower.

## How it works:

bw_plex will connect to plex using websocket and listen for any playing events.
If will then download the theme and the first 10 minutes of the episode and try to figure out when the theme ends.
This can take some time so the first ep might simply be ignored. The next episode will be queued up so its ready when you start to watch it.
bw_plex will then seek to where the theme ended in that episode file.
