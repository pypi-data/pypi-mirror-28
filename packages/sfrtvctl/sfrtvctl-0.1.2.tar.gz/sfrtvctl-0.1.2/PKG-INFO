        python library which can also be use in command line.
        
        Summary
        ==========
        
        commands are sent by websocket on port 7682 with sub-protocol lws-bidirectional-protocol.
        
        there is multiple kind of data structure depending on kind of commands we went to send.
        
        send commands :
        BUTTONEVENT structure for  classical remote keys (volume, power, ok, return, pause, play, forward, rewind, directionnal keys, num pad)
        ZAP structure to send a channel number in 1 request.
        APP structure to launch special function of the decoder (mosaic, tv guide, vod, replay, recording, media center, settings)
        SETVOLUME structure to set the volume
        KEYBOARD structure to type when inside input field
        
        Info commands (not yet implemented):
        GETINFO and GETVERSION
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        sfrtvctl can be installed using `pip <(https://pip.pypa.io/>`_:
        
        ::
        
            # pip install websocket-client
            # pip install sfrtvctl
        
        Alternatively you can clone the Git repository and run:
        
        ::

        Library usage
        =============
        
        sfrtvctl can be imported as a Python 3 library:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            import sfrtvctl
        
        A context managed remote controller object of class ``Remote`` can be
        constructed using the ``with`` statement:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            with sfrtvctl.Remote(config) as remote:
                # Use the remote object
        
        The constructor takes a configuration dictionary as a parameter. All
        configuration items must be specified.
        
        | Key     | Type   | Description                                 |
        |---------|--------|---------------------------------------------|
        | host    | string | Hostname or IP address of the decoder.      |
        | port    | int    | TCP port number. (Default: ``7682``)        |
        | timeout | int    | Timeout in seconds. ``0`` means no timeout. |
        
        The ``Remote`` object is very simple and you only need the ``control(key, arg1, arg2)``
        method. See tables above for more details about commands you can pass. You can call ``control`` multiple times
        using the same ``Remote`` object. The connection is automatically closed when
        exiting the ``with`` statement.
