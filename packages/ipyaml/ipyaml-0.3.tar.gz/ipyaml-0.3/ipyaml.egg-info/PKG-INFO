Description: IPython notebooks to YAML
        =========================

        This simple project allows one to convert IPython notebooks to easily
        editable YAML files. This is very similar to the
        `notedown <http://github.com/aaren/notedown>`__ and
        `ipymd <http://github.com/rossant/ipymd>`__ packages but supports all
        IPython outputs as well.
        
        The advantage of using this package is that you get complete
        compatibility with IPython notebooks and the ability to edit the files
        in any text editor.
        
        The format is YAML so it is not as pretty as Markdown but is a
        reasonable compromise.
        
        An example IPython notebook with the corresponding YAML file both with
        the outputs and without the outputs is available in the
        `examples <https://github.com/prabhuramachandran/ipyaml/tree/master/examples>`__
        directory.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Install the package as follows:
        
        ::
        
            $ pip install ipyaml
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Run the command ``ipyaml`` to convert between the two formats:
        
        ::
        
            $ ipyaml notebook.ipynb notebook.ipyml  # or notebook.ipyaml
        
            $ ipyaml notebook.ipyml notebook.ipynb
        
        If you do not want to store the cell outputs in your YAML files you may
        also run the ``ipyaml`` script as follows:
        
        ::
        
            $ ipyaml --no-output notebook.ipynb notebook.ipyml
        
        This will not write any of the outputs. By default, all the outputs are
        also written to the output. Take a look at the output without output to
        see that it is very easy to manually remove the outputs if they are not
        desired. Using ``--no-output`` does not remove the IPython kernelspec
        and nbformat metadata at the end of the file but that may also be safely
        removed if one does not desire it.
        
        If you want jupyter to automatically load and save the ``.ipyml`` files.
        Add the following to your ``jupyter_notebook_config.py``:
        
        ::
        
            c.NotebookApp.contents_manager_class = 'ipyaml.api.YAMLContentsManager'
        
        The ``jupyter_notebook_config.py`` can be found by running:
        
        ::
        
            $ jupyter --config-dir
        
        If you don't see a ``jupyter_notebook_config.py`` you can do this:
        
        ::
        
            $ jupyter notebook --generate-config
