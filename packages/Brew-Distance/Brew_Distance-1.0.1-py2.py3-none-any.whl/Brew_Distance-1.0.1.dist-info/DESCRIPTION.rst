Brew-Distance implements the Brew edit distance algorithm. This provides
not only the edit distance between two strings, but also (optionally) a
list of the edits required to equalize them. It also allows for the
optional re-weighting of each edit type ("MATCH", "DEL", "INS",
"SUBST"), for customization of edit distance calculations.
