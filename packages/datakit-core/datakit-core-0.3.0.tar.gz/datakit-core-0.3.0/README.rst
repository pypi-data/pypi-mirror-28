=======
Datakit
=======

Datakit is a pluggable command-line tool for managing the life cycle
of data projects.

The Associated Press Data Team uses Datakit to auto-generate project skeletons,
archive and share data on Amazon S3, and other routine tasks.

Datakit is a thin wrapper around the Cliff_ command-line framework and
is intended for use with a growing ecosystem of plugins.

Feel free to use `our plugins on Github`_, or fork and modify them
to suit your needs.

If you're comfortable programming in Python, you can create your
own plugins (see :ref:`creating-plugins`).

Installation
============

For a system-wide install, from the command line::

    $ sudo pip install datakit-core

Usage
=====

Command-line
~~~~~~~~~~~~

After installing one or more plugins, Datakit can be used to invoke the
commands provided by those plugins.

Let's say you installed the `datakit-project`_ plugin, which helps create project skeletons.

To see which commands the plugin provides, try the ``--help`` flag::

    $ datakit --help

The plugin provides a ``project create`` command, which sounds like it fits the bill.

To see which flags are available or required, try using the ``--help`` flag again::

    $ datakit project create --help

It appears you need to specify a Cookiecutter_ template to use this command. Let's
try it::

    $ datakit project create --template https://github.com/associatedpress/cookiecutter-r-project.git

That's the basic recipe for working with plugins: install, explore, and invoke! [1]_


Code
~~~~~
To use Datakit in a project::

    import datakit
