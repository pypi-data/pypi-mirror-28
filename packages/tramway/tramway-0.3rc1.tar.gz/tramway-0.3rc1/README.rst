TRamWAy
=======

*TRamWAy* helps analyzing single molecule dynamics. It infers the diffusivity, drift, force and potential across space and time. It will eventually localize and track molecules in stacks of images.

**Disclaimer:**
This implementation is under heavy development and is not yet suitable even for testing purposes!

Installation
------------

You will need Python >= 2.7 or >= 3.5.
