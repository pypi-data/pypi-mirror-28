mrcfile
=======

A pure Python implementation of the MRC2014 file format.

For a full introduction and documentation, see http://mrcfile.readthedocs.io/

Functions
---------

* :func:`new`: Create a new MRC file.
* :func:`open`: Open an MRC file.
* :func:`mmap`: Open a memory-mapped MRC file (fast for large files).
* :func:`validate`: Validate an MRC file (not implemented yet!)

Basic usage
-----------

Examples assume that this package has been imported as ``mrcfile`` and numpy
has been imported as ``np``.

To open an MRC file and read a slice of data:

>>> with mrcfile.open('tests/test_data/EMD-3197.map') as mrc:
...     mrc.data[10,10]
...
array([ 2.58179283,  3.1406002 ,  3.64495397,  3.63812137,  3.61837363,
        4.0115056 ,  3.66981959,  2.07317996,  0.1251585 , -0.87975615,
        0.12517013,  2.07319379,  3.66982722,  4.0115037 ,  3.61837196,
        3.6381247 ,  3.64495087,  3.14059472,  2.58178973,  1.92690361], dtype=float32)

To create a new file with a 2D data array, and change some values:

>>> with mrcfile.new('tmp.mrc') as mrc:
...     mrc.set_data(np.zeros((5, 5), dtype=np.int8))
...     mrc.data[1:4,1:4] = 10
...     mrc.data
...
array([[ 0,  0,  0,  0,  0],
       [ 0, 10, 10, 10,  0],
       [ 0, 10, 10, 10,  0],
       [ 0, 10, 10, 10,  0],
       [ 0,  0,  0,  0,  0]], dtype=int8)

Background
----------

The MRC2014 format was described in the Journal of Structural Biology:
http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsb.2015.04.002

The format specification is available on the CCP-EM website:
http://www.ccpem.ac.uk/mrc_format/mrc2014.php

    This function opens both normal and compressed MRC files. Supported

    It is possible to use this function to create new MRC files (using mode
    ``w+``) but the :func:`new` function is more flexible.
    
    This function offers a permissive read mode for attempting to open corrupt
    or invalid files. In permissive mode, :mod:`warnings` are issued instead of
    exceptions if problems with the file are encountered. See

            file. The default is ``r``.

    This function first opens the file by calling :func:`open` (with
    ``permissive=True``), then calls :meth:`~mrcfile.mrcfile.MrcFile.validate`,
    which runs a series of tests to check whether the file complies with the
    MRC2014 format specification.
    
    If the file is completely valid, this function returns :data:`True`,
    otherwise it returns :data:`False`. Messages explaining the validation
    result will be printed to :data:`sys.stdout` by default, but if a text
    stream is given (using the ``print_file`` argument) output will be printed
    to that instead.
    
    Badly invalid files will also cause :mod:`warning <warnings>` messages to
    be issued, which will be written to :data:`sys.stderr` by default. See the
    documentation of the :mod:`warnings` module for information on how to
    suppress or capture warning output.
    
    Because the file is opened by calling :func:`open`, gzip- and
    bzip2-compressed MRC files can be validated easily using this function.
    
    After the file has been opened, it is checked for problems. The tests are:
    
    #. MRC format ID string: The ``map`` field in the header should contain
       "MAP ".
    #. Machine stamp: The machine stamp should contain one of
       ``0x44 0x44 0x00 0x00``, ``0x44 0x41 0x00 0x00`` or
       ``0x11 0x11 0x00 0x00``.
    #. MRC mode: the ``mode`` field should be one of the supported mode
       numbers: 0, 1, 2, 4 or 6.
    #. Map and cell dimensions: The header fields ``nx``, ``ny``, ``nz``,
       ``mx``, ``my``, ``mz``, ``cella.x``, ``cella.y`` and ``cella.z`` must
       all be positive numbers.
    #. Axis mapping: Header fields ``mapc``, ``mapr`` and ``maps`` must contain
       the values 1, 2, and 3 (in any order).
    #. Volume stack dimensions: If the spacegroup is in the range 401--630,
       representing a volume stack, the ``nz`` field should be exactly
       divisible by ``mz`` to represent the number of volumes in the stack.
    #. Header labels: The ``nlabl`` field should be set to indicate the number
       of labels in use, and the labels in use should appear first in the label
       array.
    #. MRC format version: The ``nversion`` field should be 20140 for
       compliance with the MRC2014 standard.
    #. Extended header type: If an extended header is present, the ``exttyp``
       field should be set to indicate the type of extended header.
    #. Data statistics: The statistics in the header should be correct for the
       actual data in the file, or marked as undetermined.
    #. File size: The size of the file on disk should match the expected size
       calculated from the MRC header.
    
    Args:
        name: The file name to open and validate.
        print_file: The output text stream to use for printing messages about
            the validation. This is passed directly to the ``file`` argument of
            Python's :func:`print` function. The default is :data:`None`, which
            means output will be printed to :data:`sys.stdout`.

        not meet the MRC format specification in any way.
