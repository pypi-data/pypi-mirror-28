microcache
==========

|Latest Version| |Build Status|

A Really! Small! Cache! for python 2 and 3.

Why?
----

Working on a totally separate project, I found myself wanting to use
`funcy.memoize <http://funcy.readthedocs.org/en/stable/calc.html#memoize>`__...a
lot. There was a major problem, though: I couldn't test with it. There
was no (obvious) way to turn it off. It was making me crazy, so I spent
a few hours writing a small module (even smaller than this, originally)
to suit the memoization needs, with a hook to turn it off for testing.
When I got to the end of my feature sprint for that project, I decided
it made more sense to spin it out into its own project, so here we are!

Current features
----------------

-  Simple upsert and get workflow
-  TTLs for expiring cache items
-  Decorator for "memoization"
-  Enabling and disabling functionality, including a context manager
-  Work directly on the imported module... no additional instantiation
   (unless you want to)

Installation
------------

::

    pip install microcache

Examples
--------

Basic usage

.. code:: python

    >>> import microcache
    >>> microcache.has('key')
    False
    >>> microcache.get('key')
    CACHE_MISS
    >>> microcache.get('key', default='default')
    'default'
    >>> microcache.upsert('key', 'value')
    >>> microcache.get('key')
    'value'
    >>> microcache.disable()
    >>> microcache.get('key')
    CACHE_DISABLED

Decorator and context manager

.. code:: python

    import microcache
    import time

    @microcache.this
    def somefunc():
        time.sleep(5)
        return "this will be cached, and you won't have to wait a second time!"

    def test_somefunc():
        somefunc()
        somefunc()
        with microcache.temporarily_disabled():
            # now we'll have to wait again
            somefunc()
