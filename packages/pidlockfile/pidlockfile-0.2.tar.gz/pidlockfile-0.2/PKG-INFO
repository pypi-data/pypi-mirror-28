Description: pidlockfile: PID lock file module for use with python-daemon
        ============================================================
        
        This module is a replacement for 'python-daemon' pidfile module.
        TimeoutPIDLockFile class from pidfile implements "advisory" locking.
        Essentially, it does not really lock anthing. It simply checks lock file
        existence and, as a result, it can't detect certain situations like
        server process crush and release the lock.
        
        This module uses python's fcntl facility to lock the PID file. That
        means that is if daemon process is terminated unexpectedly, lock is
        automatically released and daemon can be restarted.
