In here will go what I'm terming as "WIP NOTES".
In particular, these are notes on "how things work right now"

This isn't necessarily how they should work, but how they actually work.

There may also be notes on how things should work.

In all cases, all of these docs will either have a git-hash (or
git-hash-like) value so that correlating when this information was
(probably) true can be found.

The reason for this is because I rarely have time to work on this and it's
to remind me "what was I thinking..."

Reality is likely to differ. If it does, updates welcome.
