Files that are sources of data
------------------------------

* CHANGELOG - main data source for changelog info

* site/setup.tmpl - template for creating setup.py

* site/src/shortlog.md - this is used by build_site.py to get the version
  number, which is then used to update the version number in setup.py
    - This could be improved. We could ensure that the CHANGELOG has a
      shortlog description, and that *that* is used to populate the shortlog.md
      That would

* pyxie/__init__.py - this is autogenerated from site/build_local.py BUT the
  text in it is converted to RST form and inlcluded into the setup.py file


Files that are autogenerated / have autogenerated content
---------------------------------------------
(and from where)

* Makefile (version number) -- bumped by hand OR by pyxie-dev
* test-data/genprogs (except test-data/genprogs/README.md)
   * pyxie/___init__.py
   * README.rst
   * setup.py
   * src/changelog.md
* doc/*.md -- ie all files ending .md
* doc/pyxie.1 - generated from doc/pyxie.rst by update_man.sh


Files that make changes
-----------------------
site/build_site.py -- Not pyxie specific

* First calls  build_site_local.pre_run

* Builds a sidebar for us in the html output - one item per file in site/src

* For each *file* in site/src
    * assuming the file doesn't have a "skip" in the metadata
    * Generate a page of the website in site/html
        * requires python markdown package
    * Generate a page of documentation in doc/


* Then runs build_site_local.run_local

site/build_site_local.py  -- pyxie specific

Builds:
   * pyxie/___init__.py
   * README.rst
        - relies on the existance of pandoc on the system
   * setup.py
   * src/changelog.md

   - Builds the docs that go in /docs, and also into

doc/update_man.sh - updates the (fledgling) manual page
