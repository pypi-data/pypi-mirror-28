# CloudPunch

Framework for performance testing an OpenStack environment at scale

[CloudPunch Documentation](./docs/README.md)

## Features

- **Written 100% in Python** - CloudPunch is written in the Python language including the sections that stage OpenStack and the tests that run. This was chosen to avoid reliance on other tools.

- **Create custom tests** - Because tests are written in Python, custom written tests can be ran by simply dropping a file in a folder. These tests are not limited; a test can do anything Python can do.

- **Fully scalable** - A test can include one instance or hundreds. A couple lines of configuration can drastically change the stress put on OpenStack hardware.

- **Test across OpenStack environments** - Have multiple OpenStack environments or regions? Run tests across them to see performance metrics when they interact.

- **Run tests in an order or all at once** - See single metric results such as network throughput or see how a high network throughput can affect network latency.

- **JSON and YAML support** - Use a mix of JSON or YAML for both configuration and results
