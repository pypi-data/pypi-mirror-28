        # introduction
        
        about the project
        ---
        This project is intended to provide a simple framework for quickly building source code for robotics projects:
        - allows rapid development with minimal writing of code (refer to below basic example)
        - multithreaded processsing based on hooks/callbacks - removes need for writing multiple loops yourself and facilitates management of robot components 
        - comprehensive library of classes for handing interactions with common robot components (motors, servos, ultrasounds, etc.)
        - provides built-in support for multiple control methods (e.g. autonomous obstacle avoidance, remote control, etc.)
        
        # getting started
        
        installation
        ---
        install with pip
        ```bash
        pip install robot-blocks
        ```
        
        basic example
        ---
        
        this library is meant to allow you to create software for your robot with as few lines of code as possible. Here is a minimal example for creating an obstacle avoidance robot with 2 motors and an ultrasound sensor
        
        ```python
        # imports
        from robotblocks import Robot
        
        # configure robot
        my_robot = Robot()
        
        my_robot.add_motor(position='LEFT', forward_pin=9, backward_pin=10)
        my_robot.add_motor(position='RIGHT', forward_pin=8, backward_pin=7)
        
        my_robot.add_sensor('UltrasoundSensor', position='FRONT', input_pin=17, output_pin=18)
          
        # start movement
        my_robot.start()
          
        ```
        
        callbacks and hooks 
        ---
        
        this library provides a full set of hooks that you can use to trigger certain events when your robot is doing certain things. For example:
        
        ```python
        def turn_lights_on():
          """
          Turns on the robot's lights
          """
          ...
          
        def turn_lights_off():
          """
          turns off the robot's lights
          """
        
        my_robot.add_callback('ON_MOVE_FORWARDS_START', turn_lights_on)
        my_robot.add_callback('ON_BRAKE', turn_lights_off)
          
          
        ```
