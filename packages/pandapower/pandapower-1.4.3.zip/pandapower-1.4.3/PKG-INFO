        pandapower combines the data analysis library `pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org>`_ and the power flow solver `PYPOWER <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PYPOWER>`_ to create an easy to use network calculation program
        aimed at automation of analysis and optimization in power systems.
        
        pandapower is a joint development of the research group Energy Management and Power System Operation, University of Kassel and the Department for Distribution System
        Operation at the Fraunhofer Institute for Wind Energy and Energy System Technology (IWES), Kassel.
