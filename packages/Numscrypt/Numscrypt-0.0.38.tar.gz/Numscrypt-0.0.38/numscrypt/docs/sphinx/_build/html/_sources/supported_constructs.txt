Currently available features
=============================

Numscrypt currently supports:

- ndarray with
	- one or two dimensions
	- dtype int32, float32, float64, complex32 and complex64
	- indexing
	- simple and extended slicing
	- astype
	- tolist
	- real
	- imag
	- __repr__ and __str__
	- transpose
	- overloaded operators: * / + - @, mixing of ndarray and scalar expressions
	
- empty, array, copy
- hsplit, vsplit
- hstack, vstack
- zeros, ones, identity

- linalg with
	- matrix inversion

- FFT with
	- FFT for 2^n complex samples
	- IFFT for 2^n complex samples
	- FFT2 for 2^n x 2^n complex samples
	- IFFT2 for 2^n x 2^n complex samples
	
Systematic code examples: a guided tour of Numscrypt
=====================================================

One ready-to-run code example is worth more than ten lengthy descriptions. The *autotest and demo suite*, that is part of the distribution, is a collection of sourcecode fragments called *testlets*. These testlets are used for automated regression testing of Numscrypt against NumPy.
Since they systematically cover all the library constructs, they are also very effective as a learning tool. The testlets are arranged alphabetically by subject.
