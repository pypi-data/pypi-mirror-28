Description: SPF2IP
        ========
        
        This is a Python module which iterates through a domain's SPF record data, and
        lists all of the IP addresses found within the SPF record itself, all
        "included" SPF records, and IP addresses resolved from the "A/AAAA" records found
        in the SPF records and any "MX" records.
        
        This module supports returning both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
        
        The output of this module can be used to configure a firewall dynamically when
        SMTP traffic should only be received from trusted sources such as in the event
        that you want to get email from your cloud provider to your on-premises mail
        servers without exposing the SMTP ports to the world.
