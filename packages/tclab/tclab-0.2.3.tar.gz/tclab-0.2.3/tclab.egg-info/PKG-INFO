Description: TCLab: Temperature Control Laboratory
        =====================================
        
        The `BYU Arduino Temperature Control Lab <http://apmonitor.com/pdc/index.php/Main/ArduinoTemperatureControl>`__ is designed as a modular, portable, and inexpensive solution for hands-on process control learning.  Heat output is adjusted by modulating current flow to each of two transistors. Thermistors measure the temperatures. Energy from the transistor output is transferred by conduction and convection to the temperature sensor. The dynamics of heat transfer provide rich opportunities to implement single and multivariable control systems. The lab is integrated into a small PCB shield which can be mounted to any `Arduino <https://www.arduino.cc/>`__ or Arduino compatible microcontroller. Experiments can then be programmatically controlled using Python over a USB connection.
        
        The TCLab modules provides access to the temperature control lab using Python, and includes the necessary Arduino firmware for device operation.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Install using ::
        
           pip install tclab
           
        To upgrade an existing installation, use the command ::
        
           pip install tclab --upgrade
        
        
        Hardware setup
        --------------
        
        1. Plug the Arduino (UNO or Leonardo) with the lab attached into your computer via
           the USB connection. Plug the DC adapter into the wall.
        
        2. (optional) Install Arduino Drivers
        
           *If you are using Windows 10, the Arduino board should connect
           without additional drivers required.*
        
           Mac OS X users may need to install a serial driver. For arduino
           clones using the CH340G, CH34G or CH34X chipset, a suitable driver
           can be found `here <https://github.com/MPParsley/ch340g-ch34g-ch34x-mac-os-x-driver>`__
           or `here <https://github.com/adrianmihalko/ch340g-ch34g-ch34x-mac-os-x-driver>`__.
        
        3. (optional) Install Arduino Firmware
        
           If you are using your own Arduino board, you will need to flash the
           board with the custom firmware used by the lab. This is done using
           the `Arduino IDE <https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software>`__. The
           script that must be uploaded to the board is found in the sketch directory.
        
        Checking that everything works
        ------------------------------
        
        Execute the following code ::
        
            import tclab
            tclab.TCLab().T1
        
        If everything has worked, you should see the following output message ::
        
            Connecting to TCLab
            TCLab Firmware Version 1.2.1 connected on port XXXX
            21.54
        
        The number returned is the temperature of sensor T1 in Â°C.
        
        Next Steps
        ----------
        
        The notebook directory provides examples on how to use the TCLab module.
