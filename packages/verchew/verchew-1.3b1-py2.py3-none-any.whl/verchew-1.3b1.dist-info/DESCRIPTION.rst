Overview
========

    ...chews through your system dependencies, spitting out incompatible
    versions.

When onboarding new team members, ensuring their computer has everything
needed to work on the project can be painful. Verchew is a command-line
program and embeddable Python script to check the versions of your
project's system dependencies. Its only external dependency is any
Python interpreter, which should already be installed on macOS and most
Linux-based operating systems.

Setup
=====

Requirements
------------

-  Python 2.7+ or Python 3.3+

Installation
------------

Install verchew with pip:

.. code:: sh

    $ pip install verchew

or directly from the source code:

.. code:: sh

    $ git clone https://github.com/jacebrowning/verchew.git
    $ cd verchew
    $ python setup.py install

or embedded the script in your project using `this
guide <https://verchew.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli/vendoring/>`__.

Usage
=====

Run ``verchew init`` to generate a sample configuration file.

Update this file (``.verchew.ini``) to include your project's system
dependencies:

.. code:: ini

    [Working Program]

    cli = working-program
    version = 1.2.

    [Newer Working Program]

    cli = working-program
    versions =  4.1. | 4.2.
    message = Version 4.x is required to get the special features.

    [Broken Program]

    cli = broken-program
    version = 1.2.3

    [Optional Missing Program]

    cli = missing-program
    version = 1.2.3
    optional = true

    [Missing Program]

    cli = missing-program
    version = 1.2.3

Run ``verchew`` to see if you have the expected versions installed:

.. code:: sh

    $ verchew

    Checking for Working Program...

    $ working-program --version
    1.2.3
    ✔ MATCHED: 1.2.

    Checking for Newer Working Program...

    $ working-program --version
    1.2.3
    ✘ EXPECTED: 4.1. | 4.2.
    ⭑ MESSAGE: Version 4.x is required to get the special features.

    Checking for Broken Program...

    $ broken-program --version
    An error occurred.
    ✘ EXPECTED: 1.2.3

    Checking for Optional Missing Program...

    $ missing-program --version
    sh: command not found: missing-program
    ⚠ EXPECTED: 1.2.3

    Checking for Missing Program...

    $ missing-program --version
    sh: command not found: missing-program
    ✘ EXPECTED: 1.2.3

    Results: ✔ ✘ ✘ ⚠ ✘
