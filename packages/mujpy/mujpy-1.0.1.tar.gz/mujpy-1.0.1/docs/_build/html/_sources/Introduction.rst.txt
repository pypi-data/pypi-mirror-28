Introduction
============
Welcome to mujpy, the `jupyter <http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html>`_  notebook interface for muon spin spectroscopy analysis. 
This suite is based loosely on the general layout of the Matlab `mulab <http://www.fis.unipr.it/~derenzi/dispense/pmwiki.php?n=MuSR.Mulab>`_ interface and on contamination of ideas with `musrfit <http://lmu.web.psi.ch/musrfit/technical/main.html>`_ by Andreas Suter.  


Mujpy has a Graphical User Interface (gui) format, meant to be intuitive for the eperienced MuSR user.

You must be familiar with standard MuSR concepts such as the :math:`\alpha` calibration factor, or the muon asymmetry. Refer to a muon primer, such as [Blundell]_, also at `arXiv <https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0207699>`_ or textbook, like [Yaouanc]_ for this purpose.

The :ref:`tutorial` is the right place to start if you are unfamiliar with any of the two mentioned programs. Otherwise you can venture practicing directly with the gui. You can find more detailed description of the different mujpy methods in the :ref:`reference`.
