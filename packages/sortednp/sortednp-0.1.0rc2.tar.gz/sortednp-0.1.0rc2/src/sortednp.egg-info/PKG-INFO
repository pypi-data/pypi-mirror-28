Description: Numpy and Numpy arrays are a really great tool. However, intersecting
        and merging multiple numpy arrays is rather less performant. The current
        numpy implementation concatenates the two arrays and sorts the
        combination. If you want to merge or intersect multiple numpy arrays,
        there is a much faster way, by using the property, that the resulting
        array is sorted.
        
        Sortednp (sorted numpy) operates on sorted numpy arrays to calculate the
        intersection or the union of two numpy arrays in an efficient way. The
        resulting array is again a sorted numpy array, which can be merged or
        intersected with the next array. The intended use case is that sorted
        numpy arrays are sorted as the basic data structure and merged or
        intersected at request. Typical applications include information
        retrieval and search engines in particular.
