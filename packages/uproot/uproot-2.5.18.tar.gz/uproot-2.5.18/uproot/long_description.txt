uproot (originally Î¼proot, for "micro-Python ROOT") is a reader and (someday) a writer of the `ROOT file format <https://root.cern/>`_ using only Python and Numpy. Unlike the standard C++ ROOT implementation, uproot is only an I/O library, primarily intended to stream data into machine learning libraries in Python.

It is important to note that uproot is *not* maintained by the ROOT project team, so post bug reports as `uproot GitHub issues <https://github.com/scikit-hep/uproot/issues>`_, not on any ROOT forum.
