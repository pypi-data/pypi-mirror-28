------

* version numbers for release
* Test routing still works after cold start
* Explicit reset neighbor cache as well as host cache on a cold start
* When a port is mirroring another port, it cannot have any VLANs assigned to it (would result in duplicate packets being flooded, if the mirroring port was a member of the same VLAN as the mirrored port)
* Comments clarifying mirror usage and interface ranges
* Support stack and non-stack DPs in same config file
* Add LLDP port\_descr
* Add support for system\_name LLDP TLV
* pylint
* test\_gauge.py less noisy
* Run test\_gauge.py in presubmit
* pre-commit can be a symlink
* If org\_tlv info isn't a hex string, conveniently interpret as bytes
* more git hook fixes
* More git hook fixes
* Add type annotations so that pre-commit works on faucet.py
* pylint
* Allow configuration of orginzationally specific LLDP TLVs
* Keep 2to3 happy
* Fix typo in OVS command
* Make pytype happy with use of stack config
* Clarify use of LLDP beacon service (and simplfy helper functions)
* Test LLDP beacon service
* Valve ACL module should skip description field
* Incremental LLDP implementation
* Add lldp\_beacon
* Add better config checks for stacking, add config for LLDP beacon/checking
* Add helper that allows sending an LLDP beacon packet
* Update readthedocs URL
* Prevsion 1.6.18

1.6.17
------

* Bump versions for release
* Run Influx TooSlow single process so flow stats don't time out under load
* Influx timeout test is impatient, when stats request to switch times out
* Add test for multiple DBs in gauge
* Allow the same stat to be collected into a single db
* Re-merge
* Revert "Pi builder script should only tag latest if the image is the latest."
* Pi builder script should only tag latest if the image is the latest
* Use common function for version parsing, and allow manual building/pushing of tags
* Allow configuration of OFPP\_LOCAL
* Rework order of docker tag operations
* Prevsion 1.6.17

1.6.16
------

* Need to allow packets from VLAN 101 on SwapVID mirror test, and set right tcpdump host
* Test deferred apply actions
* Defer ACL actions to instruction
* Bump version numbers for release
* pylint
* Test unknown port key
* Use config key consistently
* Verify port key must be same as number or name
* Don't need to verify meter name
* Check unknown DP key
* VLAN key must match VID or name
* Don't use set() yet for VLAN attributes
* Drop packets that are not stacked and are not in the right VLAN
* Test trying to share BGP VLAN across DPs
* Use common reset\_refs() function
* Incremental fix to re-resolve ports after warm start
* Verify packet in has reason OFPR\_ACTION (resulted from a flow specifying packet in)
* Move tag/untagged config check to Port
* Log consistently
* Log port state changes verbosely
* reparse\_ip() already has eth\_type
* reparse\_ip() already has eth\_type
* Simplify IP header size checking (don't use Ryu to calculate header size - hard code)
* Revert "Really should just check if untagged, directly."
* Really should just check if untagged, directly
* Don't need build\_port\_out\_inst() any more
* Test cannot have same VLAN tagged and native on same port
* Move implementation to build output actions on a VLAN to a common function
* metermod add are sent before barrier
* meter\_mod delete sent before barrier in valve\_flowreorder
* Fix ConfigReload tests
* More explicitly cause all ports change detection to trigger
* Test addition of router causes cold start restart
* Explicitly test native and tagged\_vlans on same port
* Disable warm start optimization on router change
* pylint
* pylint
* Add check for unreferenced routers
* Add output\_only type check
* Test bad cookie value
* Add description field for ACL rules
* Stricter type checking of ACLs and watchers
* increase max\_len for ICMPv6 echo from 96 to 128 (MAX\_LEN)
* Add faucet and gauge console scripts
* Work-around 2to3 issue
* Clarify port up/down versus configuration
* Test output\_only drop flow is present
* Test output\_only: True
* Implement output\_only attribute for ports (if True, drop all input packets on a port)
* Proof of concept for faucet launcher script
* Make source mypy compatible and run mypy in presubmit
* Ignore .mypy\_cache
* Fix ACL cookies (not actually tested as get\_port\_match\_flow() was never called)
* fix FaucetTaggedTargetedResolutionIPv4RouteTest
* Correct resolve\_gw\_on\_port()
* Move packet out tag or untagged implementation to VLAN, out of valve\_route
* pylint
* Re-enable pytype
* Limit range of ACL rule cookie
* Fix test\_gauge with cookie value
