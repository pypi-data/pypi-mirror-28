1.6.19
------

* Re-install blackhole FIB routes periodically
* Bump versions for release
* Clean up documentation on installing and running faucet
* Test stack and non stack DPs
* Allow Prometheus variables to be tested
* pylint
* Correct P2 MAC
* Test IPv6 ND
* pylint
* Add IP payload to test packets consistently
* Cold start learning optimization (don't need to delete entries for host we have not learned before, if we know no hosts expired since we cold started)
* Refactor \_is\_host\_fib\_route()
* Add jitter to FIB blackhole time
* Rate limiter shouldn't apply to route manager control plane messages
* More time for FIB blackhole
* Add nmap
* router -> routed
* Proactive resolver did not install temporary blackhole-pending-resolution FIB routes in all VLANs

* Move test suite onto new faucet start script
* Simplify L3 packet handling
* Simplify packet in path and short circuit unexpected stack packet check
* Further fix for loop protection
* Loop protect logic needs cache age check
* Simplify loop protection logic. When L2 learning, refresh flows less often, and refresh only (do not delete flows) if L2 re-learning a host on the same port
* Simple test of L2 learning up to 512 hosts
* Moves documentation and sample scripts to new faucet start script
* Add optional ryu arguments to startup script
* Tests for LLDP defaults
* Provide sensible defaults for LLDP TLVs
* Use empty list rather than None when missing config option is a list
* Update arch diagram to reflect new event subsystem
* Swap dockerfiles to use "faucet" start script
* Add documentation for running docker with additional args
* Add verbose and TLS control channel args to start script
* Move VM documentation to Sphinx
* Fix config parsing for meters
* Noviflow docs: icmpv6 match moved to table 6 instead of 3
* avoid hardcoded port in FaucetDeleteConfigReloadTest
* Test opstatus\_reconf
* Add port level config item opstatus\_reconf, default True. If False, the pipeline is not reconfigured if operational state of the port changes
* Pre-version

1.6.18
------

* version numbers for release
* Test routing still works after cold start
* Explicit reset neighbor cache as well as host cache on a cold start
* When a port is mirroring another port, it cannot have any VLANs assigned to it (would result in duplicate packets being flooded, if the mirroring port was a member of the same VLAN as the mirrored port)
* Comments clarifying mirror usage and interface ranges
* Support stack and non-stack DPs in same config file
* Add LLDP port\_descr
* Add support for system\_name LLDP TLV
* pylint
* test\_gauge.py less noisy
* Run test\_gauge.py in presubmit

* Update readthedocs URL
* Prevsion 1.6.18

1.6.17
------

* Bump versions for release
* Run Influx TooSlow single process so flow stats don't time out under load

* Add test for multiple DBs in gauge
* Allow the same stat to be collected into a single db
* Re-merge
* Revert "Pi builder script should only tag latest if the image is the latest."
* Pi builder script should only tag latest if the image is the latest
* Use common function for version parsing, and allow manual building/pushing of tags
* Allow configuration of OFPP\_LOCAL

1.6.16
