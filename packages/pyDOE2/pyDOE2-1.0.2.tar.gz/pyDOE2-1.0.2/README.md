pyDOE2: An experimental design package for python
=====================================================

`pyDOE2` is a fork of the [`pyDOE`](https://github.com/tisimst/pyDOE) package 
that is designed to help the scientist, engineer, statistician, etc., to 
construct appropriate experimental designs.

This fork came to life to solve bugs and issues that remained unsolved in the
original package.

Capabilities
------------

The package currently includes functions for creating designs for any 
number of factors:

- Factorial Designs
    - General Full-Factorial (``fullfact``)
    - 2-level Full-Factorial (``ff2n``)
    - 2-level Fractional Factorial (``fracfact``)
    - Plackett-Burman (``pbdesign``)
- Response-Surface Designs 
    - Box-Behnken (``bbdesign``)
    - Central-Composite (``ccdesign``)
- Randomized Designs
    - Latin-Hypercube (``lhs``)
  
See the original [package homepage](http://pythonhosted.org/pyDOE) for details 
on usage and other notes.

Requirements
------------

- NumPy
- SciPy

Installation and download
-------------------------

Through pip:

```
