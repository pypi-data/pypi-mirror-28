OGGM builds upon `Marzeion et al., (2012)`_ and intends to become a
global scale, modular, and open source model for glacier dynamics. The model
accounts for glacier geometry (including contributory branches) and includes
a simple (yet explicit) ice dynamics module. It can simulate past and
future mass-balance, volume and geometry of any glacier in a fully
automated workflow. We rely exclusively on publicly available data for
calibration and validation.

The project is currently in development. Get in touch with us if
you want to contribute.
