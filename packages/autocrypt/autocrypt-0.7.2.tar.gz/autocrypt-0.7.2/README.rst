If you are looking for Autocrypt implementing package
you may rather look at:

- https://pypi.python.org/pypi/muacrypt which offers
  a command line tool and documented APIs to manage
  Autocrypt-capabilities for Mail User agents (MUAs).
  It uses ``gpg`` or ``gpg2`` under the hood
  for crypto operations.

- https://github.com/juga0/pyac is an example
  implementation of Autocrypt Level 1 using the
  https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pgpy package to
  implement PGP operations.
