        If you are looking for Autocrypt implementing package
        you may rather look at:
        
        - https://pypi.python.org/pypi/muacrypt which offers
          a command line tool and documented APIs to manage
          Autocrypt-capabilities for Mail User agents (MUAs).
          It uses ``gpg`` or ``gpg2`` under the hood
          for crypto operations.
        
        - https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyac is an example
          implementation of Autocrypt Level 1 using the
          https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pgpy package to
          implement PGP operations.
