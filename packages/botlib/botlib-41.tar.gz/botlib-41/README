JSONBOT is a python3 framework you can use to program bots. It makes it 
possible to program your own module enabling your own commands and contains serveral modules that can be used to program bots.

JSONBOT has a MIT no-clause license.

install
=======

you might need to do the following if the bot doesn't work:

::

  bart@okdan:~/jsonbot$ export PYTHONPATH="."
  bart@okdan:~/jsonbot$ export PYTHONIOENCODING="utf-8"

clone the source:

:: 

  bart@okdan:~$ hg clone https://bitbucket.org/bthate/jsonbot
  bart@okdan:~$ cd jsonbot
  bart@okdan:~/jsonbot$ ./bin/jsonbot --shell

another option is to download with pip3 and install globally:

::

  bart@okdan:~$ pip3 install jsonbot --upgrade
  bart@okdan:~$ ./jsonbot --shell

irc
===

use the jsonbot-irc program to connect to an IRC server.

::

  bart@okdan:~$ jsonbot-irc -n jsonbot -s irc.freenode.net -c \#dunkbots --shell

xmpp
====

use the botje-xmpp to connect to an XMPP server

::

  bart@okdan:~$ jsonbot-xmpp -u monitor@localhost --room test@conference.localhost --shell

users
=====

you need to add a users origin to be able to give the bot commands, add a user with the meet command:

::

  bart@okdan:~$ jsonbot meet user@server
  user user@server created

to give the user a permission you can use the perm command:

::

  bart@okdan:~$ jsonbot perm user@server ps
  ok user@server

the default shell user is root@shell and gives access to all the commands that are available.

programming
===========

user programmed modules are read from the ~/.mods directory, you can put your .py files over there.

example:

::

  def hi(event):
      event.reply("hi %s" % event.origin)
