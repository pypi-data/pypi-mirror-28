Description: # A set of terminal tools that helps building apps that look nice on the terminal
        
        This is a simple library for controlling *text* appearance and placement on terminals. 
        It provides also an advanced progress bar library.
        
        The main advantages of the progress bar library included here are the
        following:
        
        * Easily show multiple progress bars controlled independently
        * Control the placement of the bars anyplace on the screen
        * Control the appearance of the bars using a simple markup like interface
        * When no information about the actual progress is available (which happens
          alot in datascience applications), it is possible to just indicate that the system is not stuck
