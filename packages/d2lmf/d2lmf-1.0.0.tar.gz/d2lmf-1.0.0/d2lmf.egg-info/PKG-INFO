        Motivation
        ----------
        
        It's frustrating dealing with the zip files full of assignment
        submissions that you get from D2L.
        
        -  Merging all of a student's submissions into a single folder is
           tedious.
        -  Navigating submissions on the command line sucks, because each
           directory name starts with a long number.
        -  Extracting all the zip files, tar archives, and 7z archives that
           students submit adds a needless extra step to marking.
        
        I've found this tool useful for eliminating those annoyances, and I hope
        you will too.
        
        How to Use
        ----------
        
        This is the most common command I use:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            d2lmf extract -R "Assignment 1 Download Oct 11, 2015 803 PM.zip" A1/T01
        
        It extracts the submissions from the zip folder into the directory
        ``A1/T01``. The ``-R`` option makes it run all the recommended cleanup
        actions on the submissions, and is equivalent to using ``-x``, ``-j``,
        ``-c`` and ``-m``.
        
        The ``-x`` specifies that we want to extract any zip, rar, tar, or 7z
        archives that students submitted. The ``-j`` deletes 'junk' like
        ``.DS_Store``. The ``-c`` collapses needlessly nested directories.
        Finally, the ``-m`` merges all submitted files into a single directory
        for each student.
        
        On Windows, you may need to invoke d2lmf as a Python module, like so:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            python -m d2lmf extract -R "Assignment 1 Download Oct 11, 2015 803 PM.zip" A1/T01
        
        How to Install
        --------------
        
        Ubuntu
        ~~~~~~
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            sudo apt-get install python-pip
            sudo pip install d2lmf
        
        OSX
        ~~~
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py > get-pip.py
            sudo python get-pip.py
            sudo pip install d2lmf
        
        Windows
        ~~~~~~~
        
        First, download and install Python from
        https://www.python.org/downloads/
        
        Then, install d2lmf with the command below:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            python -m pip install d2lmf
        
        Dependencies
        ------------
        
        The extraction of rar and 7z archives depends on external tools. If you
        do not have a rar or 7z utility installed, those archives will be
        skipped.
        
        On Windows, I suggest installing `7-Zip <http://www.7-zip.org/>`__. On
        Ubuntu, p7zip is the equivalent, and it can be installed with
        ``sudo apt-get install p7zip-full``. p7zip is also available for OSX,
        and can be installed from `homebrew <http://brew.sh/>`__ with
        ``brew install p7zip``.
