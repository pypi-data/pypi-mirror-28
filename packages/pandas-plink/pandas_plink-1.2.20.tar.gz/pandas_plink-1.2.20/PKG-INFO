        ============
        
        |Travis| |Documentation| |Gitter|
        
        | Pandas-plink is a Python package for reading `PLINK binary file
        format <https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink2/formats>`__.
        | The file reading is taken place via `lazy
        loading <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_loading>`__, meaning that it
        saves up memory by actually reading only the genotypes that are actually
        accessed by the user.
        
        Install
        -------
        
        We recommend installing it via
        `conda <http://conda.pydata.org/docs/index.html>`__:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            conda install -c conda-forge pandas-plink
        
        The above method is preferable because it does not require building
        tools, which makes the installation less prone to errors.
        
        Alternatively, pandas-plink can also be installed using
        `pip <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>`__:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            pip install pandas-plink
        
        | The above method will perform some compilation and the installation is
        very likely to be successful, as we test every release under Windows,
        Linux, and macOS platforms.
        | If by any change it fails, please, consider submitting a `new
        issue <https://github.com/limix/pandas-plink/issues/new>`__.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        It is as simple as
        
        .. code:: python
        
            from pandas_plink import read_plink
            (bim, fam, G) = read_plink('/path/to/files_prefix')
        
        | for which ``files_prefix.bed``, ``files_prefix.bim``, and
        ``files_prefix.fam`` contain the data.
        | Portions of the genotype will be read as the user access them. Please,
        refer to the `documentation <https://pandas-plink.readthedocs.io/>`__
        for more information.
