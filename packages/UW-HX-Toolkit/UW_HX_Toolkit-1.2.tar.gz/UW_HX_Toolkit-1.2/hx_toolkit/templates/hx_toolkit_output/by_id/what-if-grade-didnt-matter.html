        <p>UW is a city of learning with professors whose expertise spans a vast range of topics. Take advantage of this by choosing courses that grab your interest.</p> 

<p>Here are some ways to match your interests to class selection:</p>
<ul>
<li>What news or current events are you drawn to? What big questions keep you up at night? Identify the disciplines (tip: advisers can help!) that will help you explore these ideas.</li>

<li>Think of a faculty member who inspires you, and look at the range of courses he or she teaches. Is there a topic you would not want to miss learning about?</li> 

<li><a href="http://www.washington.edu/students/timeschd/  target="_blank">Browse the time schedule</a> or <a href=" https://myplan.uw.edu/" target="_blank">search MyPlan</a> for classes that look intriguing.</li> 

<p>It is worth your time to take classes that compel you as they can open up new ideas and opportunities.</p>
