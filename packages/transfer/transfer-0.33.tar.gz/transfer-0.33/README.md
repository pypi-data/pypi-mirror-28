# Transfer - making transfer learning easy

This is a command line tool to perform transfer learning of image classification.

Currently, it will re-learn the resnet50 model trained on ImageNet.

Furthermore, it provides a framework to serve your models!  You can export a trained model, import it on another computer later, make local predictions or setup a rest api to make predictions.

## Setup

Prior to starting, organize the pictures you want to classify by label in a folder.

In a theoretical example where you are classifying if something is a hat or a donkey:

```
~/donkey-vs-hat/img_data/hat/hat_1.jpg
~/donkey-vs-hat/img_data/hat/hat_2.jpg
...
~/donkey-vs-hat/img_data/donkey/donkey_1.jpg
~/donkey-vs-hat/img_data/donkey/super_cute_donkey.jpg
~/donkey-vs-hat/img_data/donkey/donkey_in_a_hat_this_is_going_to_be_bad.jpg
...
```

Basically put all of your hat pictures in:

`~/donkey-vs-hat/img_data/hat`

and all of your donkey pictures in:

`~/donkey-vs-hat/img_data/donkey`

## Classifying images with transfer.

First configure a project with:

`transfer --configure`

or

`transfer -c`

Follow the prompts to point to your parent image directory (~/donkey-vs-hat/img_data in the above example) and to provide modeling parameters.

Run your project with:

`transfer --run`

or

`transfer -r`

## Re-fine your model.

Want to re-fine your model with subsequent runs?  Go ahead by simply running again:

`transfer -r`

## Import model for use in predicting

`-i IMPORT_CONFIG`

or

`--import IMPORT_CONFIG`,

where IMPORT_CONFIG is the path to tar.gz file where the config.yaml and model files are. 
You can use ~/ or ~\ shortcut and it should be interpreted correctly.

## Predict on an image or directory

`transfer --predict`

## Setup a REST api to do predictions

`transfer --prediction-rest-api`
