Changelog
=========

0.7.1 (2018-01-10)
------------------

* `Issue #170 <https://github.com/jantman/biweeklybudget/issues/170>`_ - Upgrade **all** python dependencies to their latest versions.
* `Issue #171 <https://github.com/jantman/biweeklybudget/issues/171>`_ - Upgrade Docker base image from ``python:3.6.3-alpine3.4`` to ``python:3.6.4-alpine3.7``.
* `Issue #157 <https://github.com/jantman/biweeklybudget/issues/157>`_ - Remove PhantomJS from Docker image, as it's broken and shouldn't be needed.
* Switch TravisCI builds from Docker (``sudo: false``) to VM (``sudo: enabled``) infrastructure.

0.7.0 (2018-01-07)
------------------

**This version has a remote OFX upload incompatibility. See below.**

* `Issue #156 <https://github.com/jantman/biweeklybudget/issues/156>`_ - Add headless chrome support to ``screenscraper.py``.
* Remove ``pluggy`` transient dependency from requirements.txt; was breaking builds.
* Following pytest, drop testing of and support for Python 3.3.
* `Issue #159 <https://github.com/jantman/biweeklybudget/issues/159>`_ - Implement internationalization of volume and distance units for Fuel Log pages. This change introduces five new settings: ``FUEL_VOLUME_UNIT``, ``FUEL_VOLUME_ABBREVIATION``, ``DISTANCE_UNIT``, ``DISTANCE_UNIT_ABBREVIATION`` and ``FUEL_ECO_ABBREVIATION``.
* `Issue #154 <https://github.com/jantman/biweeklybudget/issues/154>`_ - Fix documentation errors on the Getting Started page, "Running ofxgetter in Docker" section.
* `Issue #152 <https://github.com/jantman/biweeklybudget/issues/152>`_ - Fix for bug where new Transactions could be entered against inactive budgets. Ensure that existing transactions against inactive budgets can still be edited, but existing transactions cannot be changed to an inactive budget.
* `Issue #161 <https://github.com/jantman/biweeklybudget/issues/161>`_ - Fix bug where Transactions against inactive budgets weren't counted towards payperiod overall or per-budget totals.
* `Issue #163 <https://github.com/jantman/biweeklybudget/issues/163>`_ - Include next payment amount on Credit Payoffs view.
* `Issue #84 <https://github.com/jantman/biweeklybudget/issues/84>`_ - Remove vendored-in ``ofxparse`` package now that `my PR #127 <https://github.com/jseutter/ofxparse/pull/127>`_ has been merged and released on PyPI. **Important note:** The version of ofxparse is changed in this release. If you are using ``ofxgetter -r`` (remote API mode), the versions of ofxparse (and therefore biweeklybudget/ofxgetter) must match between the client and server.
* `Issue #165 <https://github.com/jantman/biweeklybudget/issues/165>`_ - Remove vendored-in ``wishlist`` package now that `my PR #8 <https://github.com/Jaymon/wishlist/pull/8>`_ has been merged and released on PyPI.
* `Issue #155 <https://github.com/jantman/biweeklybudget/issues/155>`_ - Refactor ofxgetter to fix bug where ``SETTINGS_MODULE`` was still required even if running remotely.

0.6.0 (2017-11-11)
------------------

* `PR #140 <https://github.com/jantman/biweeklybudget/issues/140>`_ - Support user-configurable currencies and currency formatting.
  This isn't all-out localization, but adds ``CURRENCY_CODE`` and ``LOCALE_NAME`` configuration settings to control the currency symbol
  and formatting used in the user interface and logs.
* `PR #141 <https://github.com/jantman/biweeklybudget/pull/141>`_ - Switch acceptance tests from PhantomJS to headless Chrome.
* Switch docs build screenshot script to use headless Chrome instead of PhantomJS.
* `Issue #142 <https://github.com/jantman/biweeklybudget/issues/142>`_ - Speed up acceptance tests. The acceptance tests recently crossed the 20-minute barrier, which is unacceptable. This makes some improvements to the tests, mainly around combining classes that can be combined and also using mysql/mysqldump to refresh the DB, instead of refreshing and recreating via the ORM. That offers a approximately 50-90% speed improvement for each of the 43 refreshes. Unfortunately, it seems that the majority of time is taken up by pytest-selenium; see Issue 142 for further information.
* `Issue #125 <https://github.com/jantman/biweeklybudget/issues/125>`_ - Switch Docker image base from ``python:3.6.1`` (Debian) to ``python:3.6.3-alpine3.4`` (Alpine Linux); drops final image size from 876MB to 274MB. (*Note:* Alpine linux does not have ``/bin/bash``.)
* `Issue #138 <https://github.com/jantman/biweeklybudget/issues/138>`_ - Improvements to build process

  * Run acceptance tests against the built Docker container during runs of the ``docker`` tox environment / ``tests/docker_build.py``.
  * Reminder to sign git release tags
  * Add ``dev/release.py`` script to handle GitHub releases.

* `Issue #139 <https://github.com/jantman/biweeklybudget/issues/139>`_ - Add field to Budget model to allow omitting specific budgets from spending graphs (the graphs on the Budgets view).

0.5.0 (2017-10-28)
------------------

**This release includes database migrations.**

* `Issue #118 <https://github.com/jantman/biweeklybudget/issues/118>`_ - PR to fix bugs in the
  `wishlist <https://github.com/Jaymon/wishlist>`_ dependency package, and vendor that patched
  version in under ``biweeklybudget.vendored.wishlist``.
* `Issue #113 <https://github.com/jantman/biweeklybudget/issues/113>`_ - vendor in other
  git requirements (ofxclient and ofxparse) that seem unmaintained or inactive, so we can install via ``pip``.
* `Issue #115 <https://github.com/jantman/biweeklybudget/issues/115>`_ - In Transactions view, add ability to filter by budget.
* Change ``BiweeklyPayPeriod`` class to never convert to floats (always use decimal.Decimal types).
* `Issue #124 <https://github.com/jantman/biweeklybudget/issues/124>`_ - Major changes to the ``ofxgetter`` and ``ofxbackfiller`` console scripts; centralize all database access in them to the new ``biweeklybudget.ofxapi.local.OfxApiLocal`` class and allow these scripts to function remotely, interacting with the ReST API instead of requiring direct database access.
* `Issue #123 <https://github.com/jantman/biweeklybudget/issues/123>`_ - Modify the Credit Payoffs view to allow removal of Increase and Onetime Payment settings lines.
* `Issue #131 <https://github.com/jantman/biweeklybudget/issues/131>`_ - Add better example data for screenshots.
* `Issue #117 <https://github.com/jantman/biweeklybudget/issues/117>`_ and `#133 <https://github.com/jantman/biweeklybudget/issues/133>`_ - Implement and then revert out a failed attempt at automatic balancing of budgets in the previous pay period.
* `Issue #114 <https://github.com/jantman/biweeklybudget/issues/114>`_

  * Add ``transfer_id`` field and ``transfer`` relationship to Transaction model, to link the halves of budget transfer transactions in the database. The alembic migration for this release iterates all Transactions in the database, and populates these links based on inferences of the description, date, account_id and notes fields of sequential pairs of Transactions. (Note: this migration would likely miss some links if two transfers were created simultaneously, and ended up with the Transaction IDs interleaved).
  * Identify transfer Transactions on the Edit Transaction modal, and provide link to the matching Transaction.
  * Add graph of spending by budget to Budgets view.
* `Issue #133 <https://github.com/jantman/biweeklybudget/issues/133>`_ - Change BiweeklyPayPeriod model to only use actual spent amount when creating remaining amount on payperiods in the past. Previously, all pay periods calculated the overall "remaining" amount as income minus the greater of ``allocated`` or ``spent``; this resulted in pay periods in the past still including allocated-but-not-spent amounts counted against "remaining".

* `Issue #15 <https://github.com/jantman/biweeklybudget/issues/15>`_ - Add pay period totals table to index page.
* Refactor form generation in UI to use new FormBuilder javascript class (DRY).
* Fix date-sensitive acceptance test.

* `Issue #57 <https://github.com/jantman/biweeklybudget/issues/57>`_ - Ignore future transactions from unreconciled transactions list.
* Transaction model - fix default for ``date`` field to actually be just a date; previously, Transactions with ``date`` left as default would attempt to put a full datetime into a date column, and throw a data truncation warning.
* Transaction model - Fix ``__repr__`` to not throw exception on un-persisted objects.
* When adding or updating the ``actual_amount`` of a Transaction against a Standing Budget, update the ``current_balance`` of the budget.
