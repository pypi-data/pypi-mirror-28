Description: 
        Mongotime is a sampling-based performance analysis tool for MongoDB that aims
        to give you a deep view into how Mongo is spending its time by showing %
        utilization of various activity types, and allowing you to add custom grouping
        and filtering.
        
        This approach is particularly useful if your DB is strained by a high volume of
        fast queries, rather than a few slow ones. Besides optimizing slow queries, you
        might want to understand and change general access patterns. For example, maybe
        your DB is spending way too much time looking up a user's last login time, even
        if each lookup is very fast because of indexing.
