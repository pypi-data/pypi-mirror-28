# SlideRunner 

*SlideRunner* is a tool for massive cell annotations in whole slide images.

It has been created in close cooperation between the Pattern Recognition Lab, Friedrich-Alexander-Universit채t Erlangen-N체rnberg and the Institute of Veterenary Pathology, Freie Universit채t Berlin.

If you use the software for research purposes, please cite our paper:

## Installation

SlideRunner is written in Python 3, so you will need a Python 3 distribution like e.g. Anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/download/) to run it.

### Install using PIP

We provide a convenient installation by using pip. On Linux or Mac, simply run:

>sudo pip install -U SlideRunner

On windows, pip should install without sudo (untested):

>pip install -U SlideRunner

## Installation from repository

You need to clone this repository:

>git clone https://github.com/maubreville/SlideRunner

In order to use the automated installation process, you need to have setuptools installed.
>pip install -U setuptools

The installation procedure is then as easy as:

## Database structure

The major entity of our database model is the annotation. Each annotation can have multiple coordinates, with their respective x and y coordinates, and the order they were drawn (for polygons). Further, each annotation has a multitude of labels that were given by one person each and are belonging to one class, respectively.
