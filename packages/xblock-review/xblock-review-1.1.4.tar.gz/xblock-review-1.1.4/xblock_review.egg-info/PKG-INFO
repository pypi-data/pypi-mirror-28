        Long Description
        ----------------
        
        This repository contains all of the code for the Review XBlock. The Review XBlock is designed to act as a review tool for learners in their edX course. The way it is implemented, the XBlock pulls from all problems a learner has previously loaded in the course and randomly selects 5 of them to reshow the learner. The idea behind reshowing problems the learner has seen is to simulate a review of the concepts the problems should be testing so in retrying the problem, they are reviewing their knowledge of the concept. These review problems contain a fresh state of the problem and are ungraded so learners are able to try them without fear of it harming their grade.

        How to use
        ----------
        
        TL;DR Don't use it yet.
        
        The Review XBlock is still in testing and should not be put into any course without explicit permission from edX. We always want to offer the best course experience for all of our learners and want to thoroughly test our XBlocks before releasing it to everyone.
