# Make modem manager ignore the serial control console
#
# It should be enough to set ID_MM_DEVICE_IGNORE:="1" but it seems many
# versions of modem manager have a bug which makes them ignore that value.
#
# Setting ID_MM_CANDIDATE:="0" has the same effect but is an "internal
# implementation detail" of modem manager.
