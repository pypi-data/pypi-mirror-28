rmq-definitions
===============
*Deterministicly sort and format RabbitMQ definition backups*

``rmq-definitions`` is an application that provides deterministic sorting and 
formatting of JSON based RabbitMQ definition backups.  By transforming the JSON 
definitions file provided by the RabbitMQ Management UI, differential backups
of RabbitMQ's definitions can be made. 

Want to know when a certain queue was added or a binding was removed? You can 
use ``rmq-definitions`` as part of a cron job that writes out the definitions 
to a git repository and commits any changes to git, pushing to a remote 
location. By doing so, definition differences between commits can be 
clearly tracked.
