Civil Scenario-2-HTML  -- v0.8
=====================

Files:

  * civil-scenario2html.xsl  -- main XSLT file
  * colour-map.xml           -- Colour Lookup Table for XSLT transform
  * scenario.xml             -- Test scenario for XSLT dev
  * test.html                -- Output from conversion of the above
  * scenario-style.css       -- Style sheet for browser display of HTML 
                                scenarios

Support Files:

  * ../modules/  -- All relevant modules for the XSLT transformation 
                    (must be in parent dir)
  * ../images/   -- Image directory, shared between manual and scenario HTML 
                    (must be in parent dir)

  * test-transform.sh -- Fires off a test transformation using the dummy
                         scenario. Creates test.html as output 

Test:

 Requires Xalan (C or Java2) installed and configured on your system; run
./test-transform.sh from this directory to parse and transform scenario.xml
into test.html. This can be viewed in a webbrowser, however, you should copy
the supplied stylesheet and the "shared" images directory from
$civilhome/xslt/. to your htdocs folder.

Run:

 From this directory, fire up your fav transformer with
civil-scenario2html.xsl as the XSL skeleton file,
$civilhome/scenarios/scenario??.xml as the input stream -- output filename of
your choice. Remember, for browser display of the resulting output the shared
images directory and the supplied CSS file (./scenario.css) should be moved to
your htdocs folder.  Alternatively move the output stream and the scenario.css
file to the parent directory and serve HTML scenarios from there...

The images will be shared between the scenarios and the player manual for
browser rendering so bear that in mind if you intend to serve both.
