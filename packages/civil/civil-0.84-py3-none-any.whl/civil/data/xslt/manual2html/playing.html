  <h1 class="chapter">Overview</h1>
  <p>
    <em>Civil</em> simulates battles from the American Civil War. It focuses on
    smaller tactical battles, but bigger ones can also be played. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Playing <em>Civil</em> is fairly easy, but requires some knowledge about the
    orders that can be given to units and how they do things. Apart from that, the user interface
    follows that of most other strategy games: units, targets and movement positions are all
    selected with the mouse, and keyboard shortcuts can be used to speed up playing.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This document goes through all the needed details for playing <em>Civil</em>,
    starting with how a game is created, to gaming details and saving games. The first part of the
    document outlines the needed steps for starting a new or a saved game, and the
    latter parts concentrate on the actual gameplay mechanics.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Civil</em> is a strategy game that simulates battles of the American Civil War
    on a company level, where a company is roughly 100 men (this can be less). Artillery batteries
    have a few guns each. The action in <em>Civil</em> is turnbased, where the
    action is played as a movie after both players have given their orders. 
    A game that use a similar system is <em>Combat
      Mission</em>, from which <em>Civil</em> inherits many of its
    ideas. <em>Civil</em> differs from purely turnbased games such as the
    <em>Civilization</em> series that are pure turnbased and the popular realtime
    games such as <em>Command &amp; Conquer</em>. <em>Civil</em> will use
    turns of about 10 minutes each.
  </p>

  <p>
    Players give orders to units by clicking on the unit in question, then giving the order. More
    about this in the section <a href="#giving-orders">giving-orders</a>. After orders have been given the player
    ends the orders phase and the game will calculate the action for the turn. The action can then
    be visualized by the player(s). After this the orders phase begins again.

<a name="setting-up" href="#"></a>
  <h1 class="chapter">Setting up</h1>

  <p>
    This chapter describes how to set up a <em>Civil</em> game.
  </p>


  <a name="starting" href="#"></a>
    <h2 class="sect1">Starting Civil</h2>
    <p>
      <em>Civil</em> is always run with the union and confederate as separate
      applications. It is either played as a human against an computer (AI) player or by two human
      players. The other player (either human or AI) can be located anywhere on the Internet or an
      Intranet. One of the human players always works as a server for the game, which in practise
      means just that the player must start his/her game first, and the other player will connect
      to the server player. The AI player can never be a server, it must always connect to a human
      played server.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      To start the game issue the command:
    </p>

    <pre>
      <b>%</b> civil
    </pre>

    <p>
      If the game is not in the normal search path then the full path to the client will need to be
      given, such as: 
    </p>

    <pre>
      <b>%</b> /usr/local/bin/civil
    </pre>

    <p>
      The client needs no commandline arguments, although the parameter
      --fullscreen or -f can be given to start up
      <em>Civil</em> in fullscreen mode. Fullscreen mode can also be toggled from
      within the game.
    </p>

    <p>
      To start the game on Windows or Mac OS X just doubleclick on the icon that was installed
      along with the game. This will bring up the <em>Civil</em> window.

      
    </p>

  

  

  
  <a name="run-server-or-client" href="#"></a>
    <h2 class="sect1">Running as server or client</h2>
    
    <p>
      When <em>Civil</em> has been started a window is shown to the player. This is
      where the player must decide wether he/she will run as a server or client. If the player
      wants to run as a server the other player (or AI) will connect to him/her. If the player wants to
      be the client he/she must connect to another human player that runs as a server.
    </p>

    <p>
      TODO: screenshot of <em>Setup Network Information</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      In this window is a field where the player can input a nickname that is used in the
      game. This name can be anything, and default to the username on Unix machines.
    </p>

    <p>
      By clicking <b class="gui">Toggle fullscreen mode</b> <em>Civil</em> will
      switch between a fullscreen mode and a windowed mode. Fullscreen mode is not available on all
      platforms, and may silently fail without any harm.
    </p>

    <p>
      The player can view the game credits by pressing the <b class="gui">Credits</b>
      button. This shows a new window with information about all developers and contributors.
    </p>

    <p>
      The button <b class="gui">Lounge</b> takes the player to the lounge login. See <a href="#lounge">lounge</a> for more information about the lounge.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can choose to play <em>Civil</em> against another human player or against the
      computer. The latter is the default, as you can see from the checked checkbox. When playing
      against the computer you do not need a network connection, as the AI client is run on the same
      machine as the player uses. See <a href="#starting-ai">starting-ai</a> for more info on playing against
      the computer.
    </p>

    <p>
      To proceed setting up the game click the appropriate checkbox and press
      <b class="gui">Ok</b>. Pressing <b class="gui">Cancel</b> terminates
      <em>Civil</em>. 
    </p>

    <p>
      If the player chooses to run as a client, then another dialog is shown after
      <b class="gui">Ok</b> is pressed.
    </p>

    <p>
      TODO: screenshot of <em>Client Setup</em>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Here the player can input the name of the host where the server runs and the port number it
      uses. Do not change the port unless you're sure that the server actually uses that
      port. Pressing <b class="gui">Ok</b> in this dialog connects to the server and
      <b class="gui">Back</b> returns to the previous dialog. The client will wait after the
      dialog is accepted for the player running the server to setup the game, and then all data is
      downloaded from the server. This may take some time, especially over a slow network, as the
      full scenario is downloaded too. Note that the player running as a client can not do any setup
      of the game, all is taken care of by the server player. If <em>Civil</em> fails to
      connect to the server an error will be shown and the player is given the opportunity to
      correct any faulty parameters.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the player chooses to run as a server he/she will be presented with a dialog where the
      port for the server can be set. 
    </p>

    <p>
      TODO: screenshot of <em>Server Setup</em>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      No hostname is needed in this case. Pressing <b class="gui">Back</b> returns to the
      previous dialog and <b class="gui">Ok</b> makes the server start waiting for a new
      client. At <em>this point</em> the client player can connect, not sooner. After
      the client has connected the server player can continue setting up the game. See <a href="#setting-up">setting-up</a> for information on how to set up a game.
    </p>
  

  

  <a name="starting-ai" href="#"></a>
    <h2 class="sect1">Playing against the computer</h2>
    <p>
      Normally <em>Civil</em> requires two human players, one playing the union side
      and the other playing the confederates. There is also support to play against a simple AI
      client. To play against the computer the <b class="gui">Play against the computer</b>
      checkbox must be checked in the initial dialog. You are still required to enter a network port
      that the AI client will use to communicate with <em>Civil</em>. Accept the default
      port unless you have reasons to change it.
    </p>

    <p>
      After you click <b class="gui">Ok</b> in the <em>Server setup</em> dialog the
      AI client will be started and you will proceed to setting up the type of game you want.
    </p>


    
      <h3 class="sect2">Starting the Ai client manually</h3>
      <p>
        It is also possible to start the AI client manually if you want to. The only difference is
        how the AI was started, when playing there is no difference at all. To do this choose to
        play against another human as the server. Click <b class="gui">Ok</b> in the
        <em>Server setup</em> dialog. <em>Civil</em> will now wait for the
        other player to connect. At this point start the Ai client with:
      </p>

      <pre>
        <b>%</b> civil-ai <em>[options]</em>
      </pre>

      <p>
        The AI client has no user interface of any kind, so all needed parameters must be given on
        the command line. The recognized options are:
      </p>
    
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>--host=<em>hostname</em> which tells the AI
            client what server to connect to. This is a required parameter if the server does not
            run on the same machine as the AI client.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>--port=<em>port</em> which tells the AI client
            what port on the given server to use. Default is 20000. This is a required parameter if
            the server you are trying to connect to does not use port 20000.  </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    
      <p>
        An example setup, where the server is located on server.example.com
        is shown below. The port is the default, i.e. 20000.
      </p>
    
      <pre>
        <b>%</b> civil-ai --host=server.example.com 
      </pre>
      
      <p>
        To start the AI client on Windows doubleclick on the installed icon or select the AI player
        from the <em>Civil</em> menu.
      </p>

      <p>
        The AI client can be connected as soon as a human player running as a server has been
        started. If started before this the AI client will print an error and terminate. When the AI
        client has connected successfully it will require no more human interaction. From the
        server's point of view the AI client looks just like a human client. In fact there is
        actually no way of knowing whether a client that connects to the server is a human or an AI,
        except by the fact that the AI player does not respond in an intelligent way to chat (see
        <a href="#chat">chat</a>).
      </p>

      Setting up a game involves basically two things: starting a new game or continuing a saved
      game. For restoring a saved game see <a href="#loading">loading</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      TODO: screenshot of main setup dialog
    </p>

    <p>
      To start a completely new game click the button <b class="gui">New game</b>. This will
      show the scenario dialog:
    </p>

    <p>
      TODO: screenshot of scenario setup dialog
    </p>

    <p>
      To select the scenario you want to play click the button <b class="gui">Scenario</b>. This
      will retrieve info about all available scenarios from the server and may take a few
      seconds. When the scenarios are retrieved you are presented with a dialog that lists them, as seen below:
    </p>

    <p>
      TODO: screenshot of scenario selection dialog
    </p>

    <p>
      Click on a scenario to select it. If you want more information about the currently selected
      scenario click the button <b class="gui">More info</b>. This will show a dialog with more
      background information about the scenario. When you're satisfied with the scenario selection
      press <b class="gui">Ok</b> to accept the scenario. You are now taken back to the scenario
      selection dialog. Here you may also need to select which side to play as.
    </p>

    <p>
      Please note that you must agree with your opponent before starting the game as to which scenario to
      play and who will play as union/confederate. <em>Civil</em> currently has no facilities
      for letting players communicate about this matter, except the <em>lounge</em>
      (see <a href="#lounge">lounge</a> for more information about the lounge). The AI or human client
      player will just be given the scenario and side that the server player selects. 
    </p>
  


  


  <a name="loading" href="#"></a>
    <h2 class="sect1">Loading a saved game</h2>
    <p>
      Loading a saved game is done after having connected to a server. On the dialog
      that is shown after the connection is complete is a button: <b class="gui">Load game</b> that
      is used to load a saved game. When pressing this button a list of all saved games is
      shown. The saved games are stored by the server player.
    </p>

    <p>
      TODO: screenshot of available saved games dialog.
    </p>

    <p>
      Select a saved game from the list by clicking on it and then press
      <b class="gui">Ok</b> to load it. Pressing <b class="gui">Cancel</b> cancels the
      loading and returns to the main dialog. Note that both players must agree to continue the
      same saved game.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that in the actual game both players can choose to save the game at any time. If only
      one player saves a game then that player must also be the one that loads it, as only that
      player has the save game file.
    </p>
  

  

  <a name="starting-game" href="#"></a>
    <h2 class="sect1">Starting the game</h2>
    <p>
      When all is set up properly and you have selected a new scenario or loaded a saved game you
      are ready to start playing Civil. Press <b class="gui">Start Game</b> to begin. The
      server now sends the scenario and all other data to the human/AI client. This can take some
      time on a slow connection. If something goes badly wrong an error is shown:
    </p>

    <p>
      TODO: screenshot of error dialog
    </p>

    <p>
      At this stage the full scenario data is retrieved from the server, so it may take some time
      depending on the size of the scenario and the network connection speed. The progress bar in
      the dialog shows the progress of the sending/receiving.
    </p>

  






  


<a name="lounge" href="#"></a>
  <h1 class="chapter">Lounge</h1>
  
  <p>
    The <em>lounge</em> is a separate module of the <em>Civil</em>
    system. It works as a separate optional server where players can do the following things:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <b class="firstterm">chat</b>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <b class="firstterm">download new scenarios</b>
    </li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>
    The lounge can be entered by clicking the <b class="gui">Lounge</b> button on the first
    shown dialog. This will present the player with another dialog where the parameters for the
    lounge connection must be set.
  </p>

  <p>
    TODO: screenshot of lounge setup dialog
  </p>

  <p>
    Enter the name of the host where the lounge is running and the port it is using. This
    information must not be confused with the data for the normal game server. The lounge is a
    totally separate server application that is not run by default. See <a href="#lounge-server">lounge-server</a> for information about starting the lounge server. Any lounge server
    on the Internet can be used.
  </p>


  


  <a name="lounge-server" href="#"></a>
    <h2 class="sect1">Lounge server</h2>
    <p>
      The lounge server is not started by default when starting an instance of
      <em>Civil</em>. It is an extra component that can be run by players that want to
      run it. To start the lounge server do the following:
    </p>
    
    <pre>
      <b>%</b> civil-lounge 
    </pre>
    
    <p> 
      OS X users should start the terminal application and type the above, ensuring the lounge is in your
      path.
    </p>

    <p>
      Windows users; doubleclick the <em>Civil Lounge Server</em> icon or
      choose the appropriate entry from the <em>Civil</em> menu.
    </p>

    <p>
      When the server starts it does not show any window or similar, it's a fully console based
      application. After the server has started clients can join the lounge.

  <h1 class="chapter">Playing Civil</h1>

  <p>   
    When a game has been setup and the scenario data has been downloaded, the main game
    window will be shown. This chapter describes the basic information needed to play a game, with
    references to more in-depth information in later chapters.
  </p>

  

  
    <h2 class="sect1">Turnbased gaming</h2>
    <p>
      <em>Civil</em> is a turnbased strategic game. This means that the player gives
      orders to the units in his/her army. An engine then
      resolves the orders for the turn and generates action. The game is thus divided into two
      separate <em>phases</em>:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
		  <b class="firstterm">
          orders phase
        </b>
        
          where the player gives orders for a given turn to all his/her units.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
       <p>
		  <b class="firstterm">
          action phase
        </b>
       
          where the player watches the action for the current turn. The player can not affect the
          action at this stage, it is merely a <em>movie</em> that represents what actions the
          orders given resulted in.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      This system is really a form of pseudo realtime, as the action is always resolved by the
      game engine second by second. This makes it very fair, as no player gets the "first go", and
      all kinds of cheating that can be done in a fully turnbased game are not possible. The
      player can use as much time as he/she wants for the orders, thus avoiding the stress
      associated with fully realtime based games.
    </p>
  

  

  
    <h2 class="sect1">Orders</h2>
    <p>
      TODO: orders
    </p>
  






  

<a name="displays" href="#"></a>
  <h1 class="chapter">Displays</h1>
  <p>
    The main display contains several windows above the playfield, which normally only
    shows only part of the whole game terrain, the actual battlefield is usually several times as
    big as the part shown by the map.
  </p>

  <p>
    The battlefield in <em>Civil</em> is viewed from above. Heights can be seen as
    shadowed formations on the terrain. Units will be rectangles painted in dark blue and grey for
    union and confederate units respectively. A small triangle inside the unit shows the direction it is
    currently facing.
  </p>

  

  <a name="windows" href="#"></a>
    <h2 class="sect1">Windows</h2>

    <p>
      The floating dialogs give information
      about the current state of the game. One features an overview map of the entire
      battlefield, and a rectangle within it shows the portion of the battlefield that the map view currently
      shows. Clicking in the overview (mini-map) display moves the main map display to the
      co-ordinates selected.
    </p>

    <p>
      The next window contains the game time and unit information. Each turn in <em>Civil</em>
      represents a number of minutes, typically 10, so advancing to the next turn increments the clock accordingly.
      During the action phase it also "ticks" to visualize how the action moves on. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Above the time display, is information that depends on
      the current state of the game. Usually, it is here where information is shown about the
      currently selected unit. If an enemy unit is shown the information is very limited, but for
      an own unit all available information is shown.
    </p>

    <p>
      To the right is a window that shows the orders for the current friendly unit. For an enemy
      unit nothing will be shown. Orders to a unit as applied sequentially, i.e. in the order they
      were issued. In this window the player can see all issued orders for the unit.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the top right of the screen <em>Civil</em> will show for messages to the
      player. These messages are usually information that <em>Civil</em> thinks the
      player should know. Messages that the other player may send (chat) are displayed here also. 
      See <a href="#chat">chat</a> for more information on chatting.
    </p>

    <p>
      The messages will slowly scroll upwards until they will disappear. If a certain
      number of messages appear at the same time, causing the allocated space to fill up, then
      older messages will be removed immediately.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      TODO: add screenshot of all the windows.
    </p>
  

  

  
    <h2 class="sect1">Map</h2>
    <p>
      The map display contains all the action within the game. All units that can be seen by your
      own units are also visible on the map. Your own units are always visible, but enemy units
      are only visible if at least one of your units can see it. This simulates the normal effect:
      <em>fog of war</em>. The map is always fully visible, as the commanders of both
      armies can be considered to have detailed maps of the battlefield, or local guides that know
      the environment.
    </p>

    <p>
      Union troops are shown as blue rectangles with a yellow triangle on them, and confederate as
      grey rectangles with a red triangle. The triangle indicates the <em>facing</em>
      of the unit.

    <p>
      The map consists of several types of terrain, all with different charateristics. Roads are
      easy to move troops on, while providing very little cover. Woods provide cover but restrict
      movement. See <a href="#terrain">terrain</a> for more information about terrain effects. Learning
      the effect of the terrain is key to winning games.
    </p>

    <p>
      On the map there are also drawn different types of lines. These lines tell the
      player what the units are currently performing; where they are moving and what their chain
      of command is. The lines
      are divided into three categories:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p><b class="firstterm">Movement orders</b> which show which units are moving and where
          and how they are moving.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p><b class="firstterm">Attack orders</b> which shows the current targets the units
          have. It is thus easy to see which units are attacking which enemies, and how.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p><b class="firstterm">Command control</b> which shows the commanding unit for a
          particular unit. The player can thus easily keep related units close to their commanders
          in order to have a good command control. See <a href="#command-control">command-control</a> for more
          information about command control.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      Different colors are used for different types of orders. It is fairly important to learn
      what the colors mean in order to easily grasp the situation on the battlefield.

    <h2 class="sect1">Toggling what to show on the map</h2>
    <p>
      Most of the features that are shown on the map can be toggled on or off as desired. This
      allows a lot of information can be presented if wanted, but all unwanted information
      can be turned off.
    </p>

    <p>
      The list below contains the keys that can be used to toggle features on and off. All the
      keys toggle features, so pressing the same key returns the feature to its
      previous state.

  <a name="fullscreen-mode" href="#"></a>
    <h2 class="sect1">Fullscreen mode</h2>
    <p>
      <em>Civil</em> can be executed in so called <em>fullscreen mode</em>
      which means that instead of running in a window as is default, the game runs fullscreen,
      obsuring your window manager. This can be comfortable when you are not montitoring any other windows or
      multitasking in any way. 
    </p>

    <p>
      To activate the fullscreen mode press <b class="key">F10</b>. Press it once again to restore

  <a name="giving-orders" href="#"></a>
  <h1 class="chapter">Giving orders</h1>
  <p>
    To give orders to your own units you first need to active them. Activating a unit is as
    simple as clicking on its icon in the map. To select multiple units press the left mousebutton
    and drag the mouse (a rectangle will appear) until you have selected the wanted units. At that point release
    the left mouse button. The units are now selected. Note that one unit is always the primary
    selected unit, and it has a selection marker that is the same color as the one used when only
    one unit is selected. This affects a few things, such as moving groups of units. But more
    about that later on.
  </p>

  <p>
    Clicking on enemy units will not activate them, but instead give you some short information about
    the unit. You can not do anything with enemy units by clicking on them. Note that the information
    presented to you about the enemy unit will most likely be inaccurate, as it is information that is
    approximated by your commanders who happen to see the enemy. The information is more inaccurate if
    the distance is large (try for yourself to identify the number of men in a mass of people 1 km
    away! ;-), but the validity increases as the commanders see the unit for longer and their
    distance apart shortens. 
  </p>

  <p>
    When you have activated a friendly unit all known information about it will be displayed in the
    status panel. There you can see for instance the number of men, morale, fatigue, etc the unit
    currently has. If the unit
    has movement and/or attack orders these will be shown in the map as lines.

  <a name="combat-policy" href="#"></a>
    <h2 class="sect1">Setting a combat policy</h2>

    <p>
      To give the player control over when and how the targets are assigned to units, there is a
      feature called <em>combat policy</em>. A unit will get assigned targets
      based on what policy the player has set. There are three possible values for the policy that
      a unit may have:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          <b class="firstterm">hold fire</b> which means that the unit will never automatically get
          assigned a skirmish target. It just waits in it's current mode. The exception to this
          policy is when the unit gets assaulted by an enemy unit and it gets close. At that point
          a unit with a <em>hold fire</em> policy will override the policy and fire
          back to avoid being overrun.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          <b class="firstterm">defensive fire only</b> which means that the unit will skirmish back
          at units firing at it, but it will never initiate combat. The unit will target the
          closest and most dangerous enemy, preferably one in front of it. The same exception
          applies to this policy as for <em>hold fire</em>.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          <b class="firstterm">fire at will</b> which means that the unit is free to pick skirmish
          targets at will. It will not wait until it's being fired upon, but will start firing
          immediately that a suitable target comes within range.
        </p>
      </li>

    </ol>
    
    <p>
      To set the policy of a unit press the <b class="key">p</b> key, or choose the menuitem
      <b class="gui">change combat policy</b> from the popup menu (see <a href="#popup-menu">popup-menu</a>). This brings up the dialog below:
    </p>

    <p>
      TODO: small screenshot of combat policy dialog
    </p>

    <p>
      The previous policy is highlighted. Choose the wanted policy and click
      <b class="gui">Ok</b> to set the new policy. To set the same policy for many units at
      the same time select all the wanted units and do the same as above. Note that now there is
      no previous policy selected. Select the wanted policy and press <b class="gui">Ok</b>,
      thus setting the same policy to all units. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The dialog can be cancelled by pressing <b class="key">Escape</b> at any time. If several
      units are selected, but no policy is chosen before <b class="gui">Ok</b> is clicked
      nothing will be done.

  <a name="popup-menu" href="#"></a>
    <h2 class="sect1">Popup menu</h2>

    <p>
      When one of your own units is selected, the right mouse button can be pressed to bring up a small popup

    <h2 class="sect1">Ending orders</h2>
    
    <p>
      Once you are satisfied with the orders for the turn the orders phase can be ended. This
      means that <em>Civil</em> will calculate the action for the turn, and
      then present what happened to the player. See <a href="#action">action</a> for more information
      about the action phase.
    </p>

    <p>
      To end the orders phase select <b class="gui">End orders</b> from the popup menu, or
      press <b class="key">Alt</b> and <b class="key">e</b>. You will be asked for confirmation
      before the orders phase is really ended.
    </p>
  
  




  

<a name="action" href="#"></a>
  <h1 class="chapter">Action phase</h1>
  <p>
    This chapter explains how the action is visualized within <em>Civil</em>.
  </p>

  <p>
    When a player ends the orders phase (see <a href="#ending-orders">ending-orders</a>)
    <em>Civil</em> will calculate the action for the turn. The game will wait
    for both players to finish their orders before the calculations will be made. This means that
    if you were the first player to end the orders phase  you will have to wait for the other player to
    finish his/her orders before the action can be calculated. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Once both players have finished the orders <em>Civil</em> will calculate what
    happened during the orders phase, and then send <em>action data</em> to both
    clients. The action data can be seen as a movie that shows what happened step by
    step. Internally <em>Civil</em> uses a high resolution for the time, so a single
    turn will result in movie with a lot of "frames".
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You can control the movie playback and watch the action several times, maybe for
    instance for viewing some interesting part of the map in detail. To start viewing the action
    wait for the action to be computed and then received. From that point <em>Civil</em>
    will enter the <em>action phase</em>. During this phase only the action can be
    viewed, no orders can be given. To start the action press <b class="key">p</b> or choose
    <b class="gui">Pause</b> from the popup menu. This starts the action, and will show
    one step of the movie each second.
  </p>

  <p>
    To pause the action press <b class="key">p</b> or choose <b class="gui">Pause</b> from
    the popup menu. The action phase can be paused at any time.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    When you have seen all the action and want to review some part of it you can move to the
    beginning of the action by pressing <b class="key">a</b> or choose <b class="gui">Beginning of
      action</b> from the popup menu.
  </p>

  <p>
    To skip some parts of the action phase use the keys <b class="key">f</b> and  <b class="key">b</b>
    to move forward and backward, or use the popup menu entries
    <b class="gui">Forward</b> and <b class="gui">Backward</b>.
  </p>

  <p>
    When you have seen as much of the action as you need and want to start giving orders for
    the next turn, select <b class="gui">End orders</b> from the popup menu, or press
    <b class="key">Alt</b> and <b class="key">e</b>. You will be asked for confirmation before the
    action ends. Note that you do not have to view the whole action phase before ending. When 
    the action phase ends new orders can be made in the <em>orders phase</em>
    (see <a href="#giving-orders">giving-orders</a>).

<a name="chat" href="#"></a>
  <h1 class="chapter">Chatting</h1>
  <p>
    This chapter explains how <em>chat</em> is used within <em>Civil</em>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The chat feature allows players to send messages between themselves. The AI player
    will not chat, it simply discards chat messages without replying. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Press the key <b class="key">0</b> to bring up a small window above the panel.
  </p>

  <p>
    TODO: screenshot with chat window active
  </p>

  <p>
    Everything that is typed on the keyboard is echoed in the chat window. When
    <b class="key">Enter</b> is pressed the message is sent to the other player and will be shown
    in the messages window of the panel (see <a href="#panel">panel</a>). If you decide not to send
    the message for some reason, just press <b class="key">Escape</b> to close the small window and
    resume normal playing. The game will continue to display actions in the background, although
    the player can not give any orders while writing a chat message.
  </p>





  

<a name="command-control" href="#"></a>
  <h1 class="chapter">Command control</h1>
  <p>
    <em>Command control</em> is very important in <em>Civil</em>. CC determines
    how well a unit is in touch with its commanding unit, i.e. leader. A unit that has a good
    link to its commanding unit receives orders faster and can thus react faster to the orders given by
    the player. A unit with a bad command control will receive orders much more slowly, and in extreme cases
    may not receive them at all.
  </p>

  <p>
    Command control is determined by the distance to the commanding unit. A short distance means that
    orders can be sent to the unit faster. It is thus important to make sure that units always stay
    within a suitable distance from its commanding unit, and not break up (for instance) regiments into
    companies spread out all over the map.
  </p>

  <p>
    TODO: screenshot with nice command control "lines"
  </p>

  <p>
    In future versions of the game CC may be modelled more accurately considering the battlefield
    status. A unit that would be surrounded by enemies and have all routes cut off to the
    commanding unit would of course not be in command control, and thus its reactions would be
    totally dependant on its leader.
  </p>





  

<a name="units" href="#"></a>
  <h1 class="chapter">Units</h1>
  <p>
    This chapter describes the use of units in <em>Civil</em>. It describes the
    different stats available to units as well as the different types of units.
  </p>

  
    <h2 class="sect1">Types of units</h2>
    <p>
      A few different types of units are available in the game. Each are very different, and all
      types must be successfully utilized in order to win a game. The various types are listed
      below. Apart from only "primitive" types there are also the normal military organizations (see
      <a href="#organizations">organizations</a>) such as regiments, brigades etc.
    </p>
  

  

  
    <h2 class="sect1">Infantry</h2>
    <p>
      This is the base unit of all armies. Without infantry you wouldn't be able to do much!
      Infantry units move by foot and are thus quite slow when compared to cavalry. Their speed
      can be increased by arranging the infantry units in column mode, which will increase
      marching speed at the cost of decreased combat efficiency. Infantry is often quite
      vulnerable without good protective artillery-fire when attacking.
    </p>
  

  

  
    <h2 class="sect1">Artillery</h2>
    <p>
      The artillery unittype works as a support unit and provides artillery-fire at selected
      locations. Artillery-units may attack from long ranges and still inflict considerable damage
      upon their target. Successful attacks often require a combination of artillery-fire and an
      actual attack by infantry.  Artillery can be devastating when defending against assaulting
      close-range units, or it may totally fail. However, being under heavy artillery attack
      reduces the morale of the targeted unit considerably.
    </p>

    <p>
      If artillery gets overrun by an attacker the outcome is usually disaster for the
      artillery. Keep them out of range of enemy assaulting units, or provide some infantry
      support. Artillery has a suppressing factor for the target as well as lowering the morale if
      the fire is effective. Attacking artillery from the flank is usually very effective, as it
      always takes some time (sometimes considerable) for the gun crews to change the facing of
      the guns in order to be able to fire upon a flanking enemy.
    </p>

    <p>
      Artillery may only move when limbered. Short distances may be moved by hand, but this is very
      expensive when considering movement-points. Unlimbered artillery keeps the horses and other supplies
      behind the main line of the guns. When artillery is limbered the guns are mounted to special
      horsedrawn carriers, and can then be moved at the pace of infantry. Before the artilery may fire it
      must again be unlimbered and setup for combat. Limbered artillery is very vulnerable from attacks, as
      it is basically a very weak infantry-unit without its guns. It is very difficult to do a frontal
      attack on unlimbered and prepared artillery, and the morale of the attackers will often not
      suffice. Doing a flank attack on artillery is thus easier and will normally give better results.
    </p>
  

  

  
    <h2 class="sect1">Cavalry</h2>
    <p>
      Cavalry is the most mobile unit type, as they are horse-mounted. Cavalry is best used when attacking,
      especially for flanking maneuvres. Due to the use of horses cavalry has the best movement speed,
      especially when charging. Defending infantry may rout when being charged by cavalry, especially if
      morale or experience is very low.
    </p>
  

  

  
    <h2 class="sect1">Headquarter</h2>
    <p>
      This type of unit is the headquarter for all organizations above company level. So each battallion,
      regiment, brigade etc has a separate unit that acts as the headquarters unit for that
      organization. Headquarters that are directly superior to companies mostly affect that way the
      companies perform in combat, while higher headquarters mostly affect command delay. A nearby high
      headquarter can affect the way units perform in combat by improving rally efficiency and
      boosting morale. The player is supposed to be the highest commander of the entire army.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Destroying/disordering a headquarter would also affect the troops commanded by that headquarter.
    </p>

    <p>
      In <em>Civil</em> headquarters are modelled by having some normal units "contain" the
      headquarter unit. When the unit suffers casualities there is always a chance of the actual commander
      being wounded or killed. In this case another leader is appointed from the same unit.
    </p>
  





  

<a name="unit-stats" href="#"></a>
  <h1 class="chapter">Unit stats</h1>
  <p>
    All units have some stats that affect their combat strength. Units might otherwise be strong but
    failing seriously in an important stat might make the unit quite useless. For instance it's no good
    having a strong brigade of infantry which has no fighting morale at all, and who routes for every
    single battle. This chapter clarifies the various states units can have.
  </p>

  
    <h2 class="sect1">Men</h2>
    <p>
      This is simply the number of men that are ready for combat. Originally the unit has all men ready
      for battle, but combat of various types will wound and kill men. The strength is derived
      from those men who are ready for
      combat and who add to the overall combat strength. Resting units may transform some men from wounded
      to ready, and being out of combat may also do the same.
    </p>

  

  

  
    <h2 class="sect1">Morale</h2>
    <p>
      The morale of a unit directly reflects its willingness to fight and what it does when it takes
      casualities. Morale is always reduced when a unit takes casualities, retreats or otherwise has a bad
      day! It can also be decreased when other units visible to it take heavy casualities. It is
      increased after successful combat, i.e. when the unit manages to inflict damage on the enemy
      and it can
      also be increased when a neighbor does a 'good fight'. Morale is thus a stat that can be spread out
      among units like a disease if bad battles are fought.  The rallying skills of leaders are important
      when trying to keep the men in line.
    </p>

    <p>
      The possible values are:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li><p>very poor
        </p></li>

      <li><p>poor
        </p></li>

      <li><p>medium
        </p></li>

      <li><p>good
        </p></li>

      <li><p>extremely good
        </p></li>
    </ol>


    

    
      <h3 class="sect2">Morale when attacking</h3>
      <p>
        A unit that attacks another has a higher probability of breaking the attack if it has a low
        morale. They don't like the casualitites that they get and want to withdraw from the attack. A
        really bad morale level might send the attacking unit fleeing if the defenders stand firm or losses are
        taken. Good morale keeps the unit fighting longer, and it can even resist some casualities without
        halting the attack. A unit with high morale is usually one that has the best chances of doing real
        damange to defenders. In combination with a skilled and aggressive leader the ingredients for
        decisive victories are at hand.</p>
    

    

    
      <h3 class="sect2">Morale when defending</h3>
      <p>
        Units with bad morale are more likely to retreat when attacked, and when retreating they are more
        likely to rout. Units with strong morale will normally keep their lines together when forced to
        retreat, or withdraw rather than retreat, or retreat rather than rout. 
      </p>
    

  

  

  
    <h2 class="sect1">Fatigue</h2>
    <p>
      Units gain fatigue when they do anything except rest! Every move they make will give them some
      fatigue, and battle is tiring. The units will lose fatigue by resting, i.e. doing nothing. It
      is wise to not drive the units too hard for too long, as constantly being fatigued and in battle
      will seriously effect morale. Switch the units in the front-line if possible and let units who've
      taken a beating rest behind the lines for a while.
    </p>

    <p>
      The possible values are:

  <a name="unit-experience" href="#"></a>
    <h2 class="sect1">Experience</h2>
    <p>
      The modifier <em>experience</em> is a general skill modifier for a unit. A unit that has
      seen a lot of battle is usually quite experienced in the art of war. Rookie troops are not used to
      the battlefield and have higher chances of doing stupid things, and less experienced in handling the
      equipment (such as guns).
    </p>

    <p>
      The experience of a unit is a direct modifier as to how good the unit fares in battle. A experienced
      unit is more likely to withstand heavy attacks without incurring high casualities, while an experienced
      attacker has a higher chance of breaking through and achieving decisive victories.  For artillery
      skill is the most important stat, especially when firing from a distance, as it directly determines
      the chance of hitting the target.
    </p>

    <p>
      This modifier also affects the melee skill of a unit and directly modifies how good the unit is
      when it comes to close combat. Melees are the result of assaults where the defender and attacker
      engage in hand-to-hand combat, and neither has retreated.
    </p>

    <p>
      The possible values are:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li><p>Green
        </p></li>

      <li><p>Regular

<a name="unit-states" href="#"></a>
  <h1 class="chapter">Unit states</h1>
  <p>
    Each unit is always in a certain <em>state</em>. The state affects what the unit can
    currently do an how it reacts on different events. The state of a unit is changed by giving it
    various orders. The state is not directly for a unit, but is set indirectly by issuing various
    orders. All types of units can not enter all possible states.
  </p>

  

  
    <h2 class="sect1">Resting</h2>
    <p>
      This state is the resting-state for any unit. It lets the unit regain strength and reduce
      fatigue. Units will also get medical treatment, thus reducing the number of wounded men, generally
      increasing morale. The longer a unit rests the better the effect. A very short rest has no effect.
    </p>

    <p>
      Applies to: <em>all units</em>
    </p>
  

  

  
    <h2 class="sect1">Normal</h2>
    <p>
      This state means that the unit is in normal combat mode and ready to perform attacks, assaults and
      defend against enemy actions. A unit in this state may move normally, but movement is more expensive
      than for the Column state, as the unit moves with all men ready for combat at any
      time. Consequently, fatigue levels
      increase faster.
    </p>

    <p>
      Applies to: <em>infantry</em>
    </p>
  

  

  
    <h2 class="sect1">Column</h2>
    <p>
      This state is used when a unit is moved a long distance, and when enemy actions are not
      expected. The men are arranged in a column-mode and can efficiently use roads and paths, which makes
      movement for infantry cheaper in this state. The unit is however very vulnerable to attacks, as it
      does not maintain a high combat-readiness. Fatigue is not gained as quickly as when moving in normal
      state.
    </p>

    <p>
      Applies to: <em>infantry</em>
    </p>
  

  

  
    <h2 class="sect1">Dug in</h2>
    <p>
      This state is the ultimate defensive state. The unit will prepare good defensive entrenchments and
      prepare for enemy attacks. It is very expensive to enter this state, and it generally takes a a lot
      of time, however, it is quite cheap to leave this state for the 'normal' state of the unit.  Artillery
      in this state may fire normally, and is better protected from enemy artillery fire.
    </p>

    <p>
      Applies to: <em>all units</em>
    </p>
  

  

  
    <h2 class="sect1">Limbered</h2>
    <p>
      This state is used when moving artillery. The guns are assembled in special carriers and horses are
      used to pull them. It is quite expensive to limber artillery, but moving in this state is as cheap
      as moving infantry in column mode. Artillery is very vulnerable to attacks in this state, and if the
      attack is close-range, i.e. comes from a neighbouring hex and is followed by assault, the artillery
      basically defends as a weak infantry-unit. It will try to unlimber guns and use them for defense if
      attacked, but this depends on the skills of the men and the leader, the morale and also fatigue.
    </p>

    <p>
      Applies to: <em>artillery</em>
    </p>
  

  

  
    <h2 class="sect1">Unlimbered</h2>
    <p>
      This state is the standard firing state for artillery. The guns are ready to fire and the men are
      ready for combat. The unit may move while unlimbered, but it is very expensive, as the guns are
      basically pulled by the men themselves.
    </p>

    <p>
      Applies to: <em>artillery</em>
    </p>
  

  

  
    <h2 class="sect1">Mounted</h2>
    <p>
      This state is the normal state for cavalry. This state is used when moving the units, as well as
      attacking. Cavalry is the only unit that is most efficient in attacking in its standard movement
      state. Other units may only attack at greatly reduced strength when in some movement state.
    </p>

    <p>
      Applies to: <em>cavalry</em>
    </p>
  

  

  
    <h2 class="sect1">Dismounted</h2>
    <p>
      This state is used by cavalry when defending against attackers. Cavalry may move while dismounted,
      but there is generally no point in doing so, as mounting is cheap for cavalry, and moving when
      mounted is much faster.
    </p>

    <p>
      Applies to: <em>cavalry</em>
    </p>
  

  

  
    <h2 class="sect1">Disordered</h2>
    <p>
      This state is entered when a unit retreats and the skill of the leaders and the unit is not enough
      to keep the unit retreating in an orderly manner. The morale is higher than for routing units, the
      men are just a bit disordered, something usually quite simple to sort out. Disordered units have a defensive
      penalty when attacked and may not perform most missions, such as attacks. Units recover from
      disordered states by rallying.
    </p>

    <p>
      Applies to: <em>all units</em>
    </p>
  

  

  
    <h2 class="sect1">Retreating</h2>
    <p>
      A retreating unit will back away from the enemy in a somewhat ordered fashion. A retreating state
      may be entered by manually ordering the unit to retreat, or if it is forced to retreat due to enemy
      attacks. Depending on the <em>rally skill</em> of the leader it may take a while before
      a retreating unit is restored to normal. A forced retreat often means that the unit has suffered more
      severe losses than when manually ordered to retreat, thus it will take longer for units on forced
      retreat to rally.
    </p>

    <p>
      Applies to: <em>all units</em>
    </p>

  

  

  
    <h2 class="sect1">Routed</h2>
    <p>
      The ultimate state of disorderedness. The unit is fleeing from the attacker. Requires leader to
      rally the unit, and this may not always succeed.  The unit needs to get its morale up, maybe resting
      for a while to regain it.

  <h1 class="chapter">Terrain</h1>
  <p>
    This chapter describes the various types of terrain that can be found in scenarios within
    <em>Civil</em>. Knowing how terrain affects movement, combat etc is key to winning
    battles.

<a name="commanders" href="#"></a>
  <h1 class="chapter">Commanders</h1>
  <p>
    Each unit has one immediate leader and any number of leaders above that. The immediate leader is the
    one that has most influence over what the unit does, and is thus most responsible for outcomes of
    battles. A leader has a few important stats that very much influence the outcome of battles.
  </p>

  

  
    <h2 class="sect1">Battle skill</h2>
    <p>
      A leader with a low skill level is bound to make bad decisions, while a skilled leader may
      make extraordinarily
      good decisions when needed. The skill level is important when doing anything! It's very important when
      doing assaults, attacks or other actions that may have big changes.  Skill directly modifies all
      results. The battle skill is more or less the skill taught to the leader in military school,
      i.e. theory. The practical knowledge is experience. Together these directly modify what a leader
      is capable of doing. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The possible values are:

    </ol>
  

  

  
    <h2 class="sect1">Rally skill</h2>
    <p>
      This skill is used by leaders when they try to keep the 'spirits high' and avoid having the unit
      retreat under battle. It also reflects the leader's ability to rally the troops after a retreat and
      again create a unit ready for fighting. When the unit takes casualities this stat is very
      important.

    </ol>
  

  

  
    <h2 class="sect1">Experience</h2>
    <p>
      All leaders have more or less battle experience which influences the descicions made in battle. A
      leader may have low battle skill, but has fought many battles and built up much experience, which
      means that in order to be a successful leader, experience is often quite sufficient. A leader with
      good battle skill and experience is often virtually unbeatable. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The possible values are:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li><p>Very poor

        </p></li>

      <li><p>Extremely good
        </p></li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      A leader's experience is different from the experience of the unit the leader commands (see
      <a href="#unit-experience">unit-experience</a>). An inexperienced leader is more likely to make bad
      decisions, such as ill-informed attacks, unnecessary retreats etc, while an experienced
      leader knows the battlefield better. The experience of the unit only determines how the unit
      performs in executing the actions dictated by the leader.
    </p>
  

  

  
    <h2 class="sect1">Personality</h2>
    <p>
      A leader has a special personal style which influences the way the troops are led. An
      aggressive leader has a much higher chance of doing radical stuff, such as assaults and
      pursuits when enemies have failed and are retreating/routing. A careful leader extremely
      rarely pursues when the enemies are just pulling back, but is more likely to when they are
      retreating or even fleeing. This may cause him to miss some good opportunities but instead
      save him from hastened descicions that may lead to serious losses, such as a pursuit of a
      strong enemy that turns into a trap.
    </p>

    <p>
      The possible values are:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li><p>Careful 
        </p></li>

      <li><p>Normal

      <li><p>Aggressive
        </p></li>
    </ol>

      An aggressive leader that is very inexperienced can lead to some major disasters for a unit.

<a name="combat" href="#"></a>
  <h1 class="chapter">Combat</h1>
  <p>
    This chapter explains the possible forms of combat that can take place within
    <em>Civil</em> and how they affect the parties involved.
  </p>


  

  <a name="skirmish" href="#"></a>
    <h2 class="sect1">Skirmish</h2>
    <p>
      A <em>skirmish</em> is the basic form of combat in
      <em>Civil</em>. Skirmishing means that the unit fires constantly at a target in
      an organized manner, i.e. when ordered.
    </p>

    <p>
      A skirmishing unit will fire in a cycle. How fast a unit fires depends on its stats, such
      as the skill and morale. After a volley of fire the unit will reload and reorganize its
      lines for the next volley. The unit will continue firing at the enemy as long as the enemy
      is visible, in range and the unit itself can fire. A unit will stop skirmishing if it gets
      disorganized or is forced to retreat or rout. It will also stop firing if its ammunition
      supply is running low.
    </p>
  

  

  <a name="attack" href="#"></a>
    <h2 class="sect1">Attack</h2>
    <p>
      An <em>attack</em> means that the unit advances against the defending unit. It
      will advance in a slow march in combat formation while periodically firing against the enemy
      unit. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Doing an attack instead of just a <em>skirmish</em> may lead to the enemy unit
      breaking up and retreating. It is thus a good idea to attack an enemy unit if their position
      is wanted, or if the enemy needs to be driven away. As the attacking unit
      advances slowly the attack can be aborted easily with less risk compared to an
      <em>assault</em> (<a href="#assault">assault</a>). If a fast advance or maximum damage
      is important, an <em>assault</em> is probably a better choice.
    </p>

    <p>
      Attacks can only be performed by:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          infantry in formation mode
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          mounted cavalry
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  

  

  <a name="assault" href="#"></a>
    <h2 class="sect1">Assault</h2>
    <p>
      An <em>assault</em> is the most devastating form of attack, as it means the
      attacker storms the defender and attempts to overrun it. When a unit is ordered to assault
      an enemy it will start a fast march against the position. When the unit reaches a certain 
      distance it will stop and fire a few volleys against the enemy, before eventually
      storming the last distance and engaging in hand-to-hand combat. Either or both units usually
      end up disorganized after the hand-to-hand combat, and usually one of the units retreats or
      routs.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The assaulting unit will not run full speed when assaulting, as that would make the troops
      too tired. Instead they use a fast march/slow jog that keeps the lines intact and makes
      organized volleys of fire possible.
    </p>

    <p>
      Many assaults will never have the final storming stage, as the exchange of fire at close
      range is often devastating, and may lead to either unit breaking up and retreating or
      routing. If neither unit gets disorganized the assaulting unit will storm the defender after
      a few volleys of fire. This leads to a battle with large casualities.
    </p>

    <p>
      Assaults can only be performed by:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          infantry in formation mode
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          mounted cavalry
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      Artillery can not engage in an assault, as it is simply not possible to drag the heavy guns
      and do something useful. Artillery can support assaulting units by
      <em>skirmishing</em> with the target (i.e. fire at it).
    </p>
  





  

<a name="organisations" href="#"></a>
  <h1 class="chapter">Organizations</h1>
  <p>
    This chapter describes the organizational layout of the troops in <em>Civil</em>, the
    normal sizes, types of leaders an so on. The definition "organization" in this context means the
    normal historical hierarchical military organizations such as companies, regiments, brigades,
    divisions, corps and armies. These are partially included in <em>Civil</em> to make it
    more meaningful to simulate command control, leader influence and command delays.
  </p>

  <p>
    The actual "seen" units on the map are always companies. Some companies can contain the needed
    organizational leaders for higher organizations too. So there can be a company that has the command
    for a regiment or brigade, but still show up only as a single company. These units are worthwile
    targets, as killing or capturing the important commanders disrupts the entire organization. A lost
    commander in a regiment will be replaced, but usually with a commander of lower rank, and often also
    of worse quality. Companies with commanders for higher organizations should therefore be protected
    from heavy casualities, and should be kept near the center of the organization they command, in
    order to minimize the distance to all other suborganizations in its command.
  </p>

  <p>
    Seen as a graph the command structure builds up a tree with the root in the highest commander on the
    battlefield (such as a division commander) and spreading out to lower organizations. The sections
    below will describe the normal organizations found on the battle field and their characteristics.

  <p>
    This chapter describes how <em>objectives</em> are used in <em>Civil</em>.
  </p>
  
  <a name="what-are-objectives" href="#"></a>
    <h2 class="sect1">What are objectives</h2>
    <p>
      Objectives can be present in a scenario to mark out certain parts of the map that are
      especially important for some reason. An objective can be an important terrain feature, such
      as a bridge, a hill, a ford or a road crossing. Objectives are something the player should try
      to capture, as victory points are awarded to the player who controls objectives at the end of
      the game.
    </p>

    <p>
      On the map, objectives are shown with these symbols:
    </p>

    <p>
      TODO: small screenshot of objective on map
    </p>

    <p>
      There are two kinds of objectives. The golden objective is a primary objective and is worth
      more victory points than the silver one See <a href="#victory-points">victory-points</a> for more
      information. A scenario may not always use both objectives types, it may not even use
      objectives at all, if it does not fit into the scenario type.
    </p>

    <p>
      Objectives are captured by making sure that no enemy units are within a certain range from the
      objective, and that at least one friendly unit that has not disrupted or routed is near the objective.
    </p>

  


  <a name="victory-points" href="#"></a>
    <h2 class="sect1">Victory points</h2>
    <p>
      When the game ends victory points are awarded for each objective the player holds. An
      objective that is not held by any player is considered to be neutral, and does not award
      either player victory points.  There are two kinds of objectives:

<a name="reinforcements" href="#"></a>
  <h1 class="chapter">Reinforcements</h1>
  <p>
    This chapter discusses how reinforcements work in <em>Civil</em>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Reinforcements are troops that arrive late to a battlefield. Usually most
    troops are already present at the location for the battle, but some troops
    may arrive later during the day, or over the course of several days if it's a long
    battle. Not all scenarios have reinforcements, it's up to the scenario
    designer to decide if reinforcements are available.
  </p>

  <p>
    Reinforcements arrive at some location very near the edge of the map, usually in the rear. If
    several units arrive at the same location (for instance a road) the first ones to arrive may
    be placed a bit from the edge to give space to the others. As soon as units have arrived on the
    map they may be controlled in the same way as any other unit.
  </p>

  <p>
    The time and location where reinforcements arrive is decided by the
    scenario designer; the player can in no way affect the arrival times.

  <h1 class="chapter">Saving a game</h1>

  <p>
    This chapter explains how to save games.
  </p>

  <p>
    Saving games in <em>Civil</em> is very simple. The game can only be saved during the
    orders phase, not the action phase. To save the game,  press the keys <b class="key">Alt</b> and
    <b class="key">s</b>. This will bring up a dialog where you will be asked wether the game should
    be saved or not.
  </p>

  <p>
    TODO: screenshot of question.
  </p>

  <p>
    Click <b class="gui">Ok</b> to save and <b class="gui">Cancel</b> to abort the
    saving. If you chose to save the game another dialog will be shown where you can enter a
    name.
  </p>

  <p>
    TODO: screenshot of input dialog.
  </p>

  <p>
    Press <b class="gui">Ok</b> or <b class="key">Enter</b> to accept the name and save the
    game. If the given name was empty, ie. nothing was written then the saving is aborted. The
    actual saving process will take some time, so please be patient. 
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Civil</em> saves games in a directory
    <b class="filename">$HOME./civil/saved_games</b>. The saved games are available for loading from
    the main dialog (see <a href="#loading">loading</a>).

  <h1 class="chapter">Scenario management</h1>
  <p>
    This chapter explains how scenarios are managed.
  </p>

  
    <p>
      This chapter is still very much vapour!
    </p>
  

  

  <a name="adding-scenarios-globally" href="#"></a>
    <h2 class="sect1">Adding scenarios globally</h2>

    <p>
      All scenarios in <em>Civil</em> are managed by the player that acts as the
      server. The client player only downloads them from the server when a game is started, and does
      not store them locally in any way. So players can play a game where only one player has a
      scenario by having that player act as the server. To add a new scenario to a server the server
      must be made aware of the new scenario.
    </p>

    <p>
      The first step is to download the scenario from somewhere, and then copy the files (two
      <em>XML</em> files) into the <b class="filename">scenarios</b> directory of the
      <em>Civil</em> installation. This is typically:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p><b class="firstterm">Unix</b>: <b class="filename">/usr/share/games/civil/scenarios/</b>
          or <b class="filename">/usr/share/games/civil/scenarios/</b>. TODO: check these paths.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p><b class="firstterm">Windows</b>: <b class="filename">c:\Program Files\Civil\scenarios\</b>
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      After this <em>Civil</em> can be restarted with the player that just
      installed the new scenarios acting as the server. The new scenario will be selectable from the
      list of scenarios when a new game is started (see <a href="#game-settings">game-settings</a>).
    </p>

    <p>
      Scenarios installed in this way are available to all users that can play
      <em>Civil</em> on the host machine. To install a scenario for only one player see the
      next section.
    </p>
    <p>
      Windows NT, 2000 and XP users should check they have the correct permissions to access the 
      installation directory and run civil. In extreme cases your system administrator can deny 
      users full rights to the installation directory, in which case consult with your local expert on 
      how to correctly setup Civil for multi-user play.
    </p>
  

  

  <a name="adding-scenarios-locally" href="#"></a>
    <h2 class="sect1">Adding scenarios locally</h2>

    <p>
      Scenarios can also be added so that only the local player can use them. Do do this follow the
      instructions above, but replace the path
      <b class="filename">/usr/share/games/civil/scenarios/</b> with the path
      <b class="filename">$HOME/.civil/scenarios/</b>. Now the downloaded scenarios are only available
      to the player who installed them.
    </p>
  


  


  <a name="adding-scenarios-lounge" href="#"></a>
    <h2 class="sect1">Getting scenarios from the lounge</h2>

    <p>
      Scenarios can also be downloaded from the <em>lounge</em> (see <a href="#lounge">lounge</a>). This is done in a fully graphical way, and the scenarios can be
      downloaded from any lounge on the Internet. Scenarios downloaded in this way will be saved
      locally for the player downloading, just like in the section above (see <a href="#adding-scenarios-locally">adding-scenarios-locally</a>).
    </p>
  


  


  <a name="using-admin-tool" href="#"></a>
    <h2 class="sect1">Using the tool civil-scenario-admin</h2>

    <p>
      <em>Civil</em> can also download scenarios from scenario repositories through a
      scenario server. To do this use the tool <b class="filename">civil-scenario-admin</b> that is
      not yet written, and thus is very much vaporware. This tool allows the player to conenct to
      scenario servers around the world, check for new scenarios and download interesting
      ones. Note that these servers have nothing to do with the normal game server,
      i.e. <b class="filename">civil-server</b>, which is used when playing the game. The scenario
      server just manage scenarios and let players browse scenarios.
    </p>

    <p>
      To use the tool <b class="filename">civil-scenario-admin</b> start it like this:
    </p>

    <pre>
      <b>%</b> civil-scenario-admin --server=server.example.com --port=8080 
    </pre>

    <p>
      After it has started it will show a simple menu which allows you to list scenarios that are
      available for download from the server and to download one or more of the scenarios. When a
      scenario is downloaded it is automatically added to the scenarios that the local game server
      can use. No extra configuration is needed.
    </p>
  

  

  <a name="scenario-server" href="#"></a>
    <h2 class="sect1">Scenario server</h2>
    
    <p>
      You can also run your own scenario server if you want to share your scenarios with
      people all around the net. To do this you need to use the server
      <b class="filename">civil-scenario-server</b> that performs the sharing. To start the server
      run the following command:
    </p>
    
    <pre>
      <b>%</b> civil-scenario-server 
    </pre>

    <p>
      This will launch the server and make it listen on port 8080. It will then share out
      scenarios to players that connect to the server using
      <b class="filename">civil-scenario-admin</b>. Clients can get listings of the scenarios your
      server shares and optionally download one or more of them. 
    </p>

    <p>
      By default the server shares out all the normal scenarios that it can find, i.e. the same
      that the normal game server would use.

          No keys seem to do anything?
        </h3>
      
      <blockquote class="answer">
        
          This one is weird. Probably a bug somewhere in our code. The solution seems to be to make
          sure that <b class="key">Num Lock</b> is not pressed. Having it pressed (lit) seems to
          lose all keyboard input.
        
        
          Some Apple keyboards (TiBook, PowerBook etc.) require a qualifer key: <b class="key">FN</b> to 
          be pressed in order to access Functions keys. Don't forget this during the game! If you still
          have difficulty under OS X, check your Pygame installation. There have been known problems
          with keyboard input under Fullscreen mode in OS X that have been fixed by reinstallation of
          Pygame.

	  Currently, the Civil installer doesn't configure a HOME environment variable, which is something the game needs in
