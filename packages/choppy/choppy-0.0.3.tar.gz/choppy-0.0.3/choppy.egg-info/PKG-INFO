        =======
        chop -> encrypt -> (?) -> decrypt -> merge
        
        Choppy partitions files and encrypts using symmetric authenticated cryptography.
        After decryption, embedded metadata provides for the original input file to be recreated and verified.
        
        - selectable number of partitions and randomized file size
        - secure cryptographic key/password input or via file
        - sequential numeric or randomized file names
        - encrypted file chunks can have name and extension altered with no detriment to recreating input file
        - chunks from multiple files can be located within the same directory and the merge command will locate and reassemble original input files
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Using pip:
        
        ::
        
            pip install choppy
        
        Without pip - clone repository:
        
        ::
        
            python setup.py install
        
        
        Command Line Usage
        ------------------
        
        See
        `Usage <https://github.com/j4c0bs/choppy/blob/master/docs/usage.md>`_
        for advanced use and expanded options.
        
        
        generate cryptographic key file (key.txt)
        
        ::
        
            choppy gen -k
        
        create 10 partitions of infile.txt, randomize partition size by 50% and encrypt with key file
        
        ::
        
            choppy chop infile.txt -n 10 -w 50 --use-key -i key.txt
        
        decrypt partitions and merge to reassemble original file
        
        ::
        
            choppy merge *.chp.* --use-key -i key.txt
        
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        - Python 3.6 or greater
        - cryptography 2.1.3
