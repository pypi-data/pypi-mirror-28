Description: choppy
        =======
        chop -> encrypt -> (?) -> decrypt -> merge
        
        Choppy partitions files and encrypts using symmetric authenticated cryptography.
        After decryption, embedded metadata provides for the original input file to be recreated and verified.
        
        Features:
        - selectable number of partitions and randomized file size
        - straight forward cryptographic key/password input
        - encrypted file chunks can have name and extension altered with no detriment to recreating input file
        - chunks from multiple files can be located within the same directory and the merge command will locate and
        reassemble original input files
