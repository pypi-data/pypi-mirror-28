Accessing the interactions
==========================

This tutorial will show you briefly how to access the detailed interaction
results corresponding to the tournament.

To access the detailed interaction results we create a tournament as usual
(see :ref:`creating_tournaments`) but indicate that we want to keep track of the
interactions::

    >>> import axelrod as axl
    >>> players = [
    ...     axl.Cooperator(), axl.Defector(),
    ...     axl.TitForTat(), axl.Grudger()]
    >>> tournament = axl.Tournament(players, turns=3, repetitions=1)
    >>> results = tournament.play(keep_interactions=True)

If the play method is called with :code:`keep_interactions=True`, the result set
object will have an :code:`interactions` attribute which contains all the
interactions between the players. These can be used to
view the history of the interactions::

    >>> for index_pair, interaction in sorted(results.interactions.items()):
    ...     player1 = tournament.players[index_pair[0]]
    ...     player2 = tournament.players[index_pair[1]]
    ...     print('%s vs %s: %s' % (player1, player2, interaction[0]))
    Cooperator vs Cooperator: [(C, C), (C, C), (C, C)]
    Cooperator vs Defector: [(C, D), (C, D), (C, D)]
    Cooperator vs Tit For Tat: [(C, C), (C, C), (C, C)]
    Cooperator vs Grudger: [(C, C), (C, C), (C, C)]
    Defector vs Defector: [(D, D), (D, D), (D, D)]
    Defector vs Tit For Tat: [(D, C), (D, D), (D, D)]
    Defector vs Grudger: [(D, C), (D, D), (D, D)]
    Tit For Tat vs Tit For Tat: [(C, C), (C, C), (C, C)]
    Tit For Tat vs Grudger: [(C, C), (C, C), (C, C)]
    Grudger vs Grudger: [(C, C), (C, C), (C, C)]

We can use these interactions to reconstruct :code:`axelrod.Match` objects which
have a variety of available methods for analysis (more information can be found
in :ref:`creating_matches`)::

    >>> matches = []
    >>> for index_pair, interaction in sorted(results.interactions.items()):
    ...     player1 = tournament.players[index_pair[0]]
    ...     player2 = tournament.players[index_pair[1]]
    ...     match = axl.Match([player1, player2], turns=3)
    ...     match.result = interaction[0]
    ...     matches.append(match)
    >>> len(matches)
    10

As an example let us view all winners of each match (:code:`False` indicates a
tie)::

    >>> for match in matches:
    ...     print("{} v {}, winner: {}".format(match.players[0], match.players[1], match.winner()))
    Cooperator v Cooperator, winner: False
    Cooperator v Defector, winner: Defector
    Cooperator v Tit For Tat, winner: False
    Cooperator v Grudger, winner: False
    Defector v Defector, winner: False
    Defector v Tit For Tat, winner: Defector
    Defector v Grudger, winner: Defector
    Tit For Tat v Tit For Tat, winner: False
    Tit For Tat v Grudger, winner: False
    Grudger v Grudger, winner: False
