# empyscripts

This repo contains *add-ons* for `empymod`. These are scripts that did not make
it into `empymod`. Most likely because they require some sort of change to the
`empymod` core features, but are only for a very specific use cases. Hence it
was decided to not implement them in `empymod`.

Please note that these add-ons are not as thoroughly tested as `empymod`, and
potentially not as well documented either.
