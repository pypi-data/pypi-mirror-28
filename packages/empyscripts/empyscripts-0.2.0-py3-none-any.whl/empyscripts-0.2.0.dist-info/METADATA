# empyscripts

This repo contains *add-ons* for `empymod`. These are scripts that did not make
it into `empymod`. Most likely because they require some sort of change to the
`empymod` core features, but are only for a very specific use cases. Hence it
was decided to not implement them in `empymod`.

Please note that these add-ons are not as thoroughly tested as `empymod`, and
potentially not as well documented either.


## More information

For information regarding `empymod` have a look at:
[empymod.github.io](https://empymod.github.io).


## Installation

You can install empyscripts via `conda`

```bash
conda install -c prisae empyscripts

via `pip`:

```bash
pip install empyscripts
```

or download this repo and run

python setup.py install
```


## Add-ons

- `tmtemod`: Return up- and down-going TM/TE-mode contributions for x-directed
  electric sources and receivers, which are located in the same layer.
- `fdesign`: Design digital linear filters for the Hankel and Fourier
  transforms.
