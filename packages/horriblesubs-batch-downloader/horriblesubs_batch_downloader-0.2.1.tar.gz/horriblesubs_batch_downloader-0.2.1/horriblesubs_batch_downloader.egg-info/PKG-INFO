        =============================
        
        Often times I find that HorribleSubs does not upload a single torrent
        containing all episodes of an anime, or as they call them, *batches*.
        
        This scraper will search all their shows given a search word (via
        command line or after prompt during program execution), and download all
        episodes of the desired show in the highest resolution available.
