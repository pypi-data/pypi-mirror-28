Description: ### WebRequest
        
        Like the `requests` library, but shittier.
        
        Provides convenience functions for writing web-scrapers and other web-interactive
        things. Built-in support for working through CloudFlare's garbage JS browser
        checks without any intervention, as well as some other [garbage web-application 
        firewall shits](https://sucuri.net/website-firewall/) that seem intent on 
        breaking the internet.
        
        Built-in user-agent randomization. Support for fetching rendered content via 
        headless chrome.
        
        Default support for compressed transfers. 
        
        Basically, the overall goal is to have a simple library that acts *as much as 
        possible* like a "real" browser. Ideally, it should be indistinguishable from 
        an actual browser from the perspective of the remote HTTP(s) server.
        
        Q: Why  
        A: Because I started writing horrible web-scraper things in 2008, when the 
        requests library wasn't really a thing.  
        
        Q: Why *still*, then?  
        A: Anger and spite, mostly.  
        
        Q: No, really, *why*  
        A: Ok, Because I want to download the internet, and idiots post stuff, and then
            try to "protect" it from scraping with stupid jerberscript bullshit.
        
        ## Note: If your non-interactive webite requires me to execute javascript to view it, FUCK YOU, you are a horrible person who is actively ruining the internet.
