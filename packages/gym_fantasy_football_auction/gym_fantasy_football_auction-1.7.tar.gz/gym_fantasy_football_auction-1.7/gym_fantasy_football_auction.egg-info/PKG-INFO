Summary: Gym environment for doing a fantasy football auction. A set of players, each with some predetermined value (this is usually based on projections / expert consensus) is available for auction drafting, and the agent must try to auction in such a way as to create the  team with the highest value. These environments all simulate other players as simple scripted agents who behave pretty much like the average fantasy player.
