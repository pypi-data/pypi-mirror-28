Introduction
============
This package provides python bindings for the `LZ4 compression library
<https://lz4.github.io/lz4/>`_.

The bindings provided in this package cover the `frame format
<http://lz4.github.io/lz4/lz4_Frame_format.html>`_ and the `block format
<http://lz4.github.io/lz4/lz4_Block_format.html>`_ specifications. The frame
format bindings are the recommended ones to use, as this guarantees
interoperability with other implementations and language bindings.

A future release may implement support for the LZ4 stream format. Patches and
help are welcome.
