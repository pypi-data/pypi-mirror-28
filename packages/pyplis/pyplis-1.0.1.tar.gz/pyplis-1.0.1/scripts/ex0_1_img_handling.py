Pyplis introduction script 1 - Image import

This script loads an exemplary image which is part of the pyplis suppl.
data. Image data in pyplis is represented by the ``Img`` class, which also
allows for storage of image meta data and keeps track of changes applied to 
the image data (e.g. cropping, blurring, dark correction).

The script also illustrates how to manually work with image meta data 
encrypted in the image file name. The latter can be performed automatically in 
pyplis using file name conventions (which can be specified globally, see next 
script).
