XSteam
======
Original Released by Magnus Holmgren for Matlab and Excel: http://xsteam.sourceforge.net and/or http://www.x-eng.com

XSteam provides (mostly) accurate steam and water properties from 0 - 1000 bar and from
0 - 2000 °C according to the IAPWS release IF-97.
(www.iapws.org) http://www.iapws.org/relguide/IF97-Rev.pdf
For accuracy of the functions in different regions see IF-97 Page 4

Also includes thermal conductivity and viscosity, wich are not part of the IF97 release.

Viscosity: (2003)


Requirements
============

Tests require numpy, Demos require numpy and matplotlib


Install
=======
run "python setup.py" install
To test is setup was successful, run bin/pyXSteamDemo.py from the command line.
There are still (as of v0.3.2) some Errors in Thermal Conductivity and Speed of sound functions,
so be warned that they exceed the Error Range.
Apart form accuracy errors, there should be no warnings.
to run unittests: "python setup.py test" but make sure numpy is installed


Nomenclature
============
All Functions follow the same naming schema:
First the wanted property, then a underscore "_", then the wanted input properties
Example: t_ph is temperature as a function of pressure and enthalpy.
For a list of valid functions se bellow:
  t    Temperature  (°C or °F)
  p    Pressure  (bar or psi)
  h    Enthalpy  (kJ/kg or btu/lb)
  v    Specific volume  (m3/kg or ft^3/lb)
  rho  Density  (kg/m3 or lb/ft^3)
  s    Specific entropy  (kJ/(kg °C) or btu/(lb °F))
  u    Specific internal energy  (kJ/kg or btu/lb)
  Cp   Specific isobaric heat capacity  (kJ/(kg °C) or btu/(lb °F))
  Cv   Specific isochoric heat capacity  (kJ/(kg °C) or btu/(lb °F))
  w    Speed of sound  (m/s or ft/s)
  my   Viscosity  (N s/m^2 or lbm/ft/hr)
  tc   Thermal Conductivity  (W/(m °C) or btu/(h ft °F))
  st   Surface Tension  (N/m or lb/ft)
  x    Vapour fraction
  vx   Vapour Volume Fraction


Usage
=====
Simple Example:
  from pyXSteam.XSteam import XSteam
  steamTable = XSteam(XSteam.UNIT_SYSTEM_MKS)
  print steamTable.hL_p(220.0)

By using the unitSystem Parameter, you can tell XSteam witch Unit System you are using.
  steamTable = XSteam(XSteam.UNIT_SYSTEM_MKS): m/kg/sec/°C/bar/W
  steamTable = XSteam(XSteam.UNIT_SYSTEM_FLS): ft/lb/sec/°F/psi/btu
  steamTable = XSteam(XSteam.UNIT_SYSTEM_BARE): m/kg/sec/K/MPa/W

To enable logging, add the following lines to your code:
  import logging
  logger = logging.getLogger('pyXSteam')
  logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
  sh = logging.StreamHandler()
  sh.setFormatter(logging.Formatter('%(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'))
  logger.addHandler(sh)
