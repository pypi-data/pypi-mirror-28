Undertime - pick a meeting time
===============================

Undertime is a rewrite of `overtime-cli`_ in Python because I felt we
shouldn't need a Javascript virtual machine to pick a time. I was also
curious to see how such a rewrite would look like and was tired of
loading a web browser every time I needed to figure out what time it
was elsewhere in the world or when I needed to coordinate
international meetings.

   :alt: undertime computing possible meeting time for multiple timezones

Usage
=====

Timezones should be passed on the commandline and are matched against
the `list of known timezones`_, as defined by the `pytz`_
package. Exact matches are attempted at first, but if that fails,
substring matches are allowed, which makes it possible to do this::

  undertime.py New_York Los_Angeles

The complete list of timezones is also shown when the
``--print-zones`` commandline option is provided.

Colors are used to highlight the "work hours" where possible meeting
times could overlap. You can change those work hours with the
``--start`` and ``--end`` flags. Because daylight savings may actually
change time, you can also use the ``--date`` time to pick an arbitrary
time for the meeting, using natural language (as parsed by the
`parsedatetime`_ library). The current time is also shown, in bold.

Full usage is available with the ``--help`` flag.

Known issues and limitations
============================

There are weird alignment issues when using colors, which seems to be
a bug with the upstream `terminaltables`_ library, filed as `issue
#55`_.

It is possible that daylight saving times computations are
incorrect. There are no unit tests for this program, which was only
manually tested with some commonly used timezones.

Timezones are a delicate and complicated subject, and change
constantly. What may be applicable to your location at the current
time may not be reflected by your operating system or the chain of
software used by this program to determine time.

It should be possible for the program to show the user which are the
best times to possibly do a meeting. Those, for example, could be
outlined in green or underlined to make it more obvious when the best
matches are.
