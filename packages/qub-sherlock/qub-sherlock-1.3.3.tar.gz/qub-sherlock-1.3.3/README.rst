*A python package and command-line tools to contextually classify astronomical transient sources. Sherlock mines a library of historical and on-going survey data to attempt to identify the source of a transient event, and predict the classification of the event based on the associated crossmatched data*.

        cat                     import a static catalogue into the crossmatch catalogues database
        stream                  download/stream new data from a give source catalogue into the sherlock crossmatch catalogues database
        info                    print an overview of the current catalogues, views and streams in the sherlock database ready for crossmatching
    
        ra                      the right-ascension coordinate with which to perform a conesearch (sexegesimal or decimal degrees)
        dec                     the declination coordinate with which to perform a conesearch (sexegesimal or decimal degrees)

Documentation
=============

Documentation for sherlock is hosted by `Read the Docs <http://sherlock.readthedocs.org/en/stable/>`__ (last `stable version <http://sherlock.readthedocs.org/en/stable/>`__ and `latest version <http://sherlock.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`__).

Installation
============

The easiest way to install sherlock is to use ``pip``:

.. code:: bash

    pip install qub-sherlock

Or you can clone the `github repo <https://github.com/thespacedoctor/sherlock>`__ and install from a local version of the code:

.. code:: bash

    git clone git@github.com:thespacedoctor/sherlock.git
    cd sherlock
    python setup.py install

To upgrade to the latest version of sherlock use the command:

.. code:: bash

    pip install qub-sherlock --upgrade

.. todo::

    - make a note about how to setup mysql login paths and have them associated with the database setting in the sherlock settings file

.. code:: bash

    mysql_config_editor set --login-path=xxx --host=127.0.0.1 --user=myuser --password --port=xxx


Development
-----------

If you want to tinker with the code, then install in development mode.
This means you can modify the code from your cloned repo:

.. code:: bash

    git clone git@github.com:thespacedoctor/sherlock.git
    cd sherlock
    python setup.py develop
