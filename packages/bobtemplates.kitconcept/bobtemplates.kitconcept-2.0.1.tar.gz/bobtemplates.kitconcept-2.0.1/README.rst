bobtemplates.kitconcept
=======================

``bobtemplates.kitconcept`` provides a `mr.bob <http://mrbob.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_ template to generate packages for Plone projects.

This is a fork of bobtemplates.plone 1.x. The scope of this package is simplicity, maintainablility and testability.

We contributed to ZopeSkel and templer and this package is an attempt to prevent doing what we consider to be "the same mistakes" over and over again.

Design Goals

- Simple is better than complex.
- Cover 80% of use cases, donâ€™t become too complex.
- Provide a good starting point for development, not a swiss army knife for the entire development cycle.
- Code and tests should reflect the current coding best practice.
- Generated code should have 100% test coverage.

Concrete Decisions

- Do not use local commands. They significantly increase complexity and mr.bob has no support for them anyways. We tried this with ZopeSkel/Templer and it did not work out that well.
- Limit the overall number of questions to not confuse people too much. Having separate packages or providing commented out code sections might be a good alternative.
- Fix problems in Plone itself rather than providing workarounds in our templates. (see #27)
- Provide skeletons for the most important Plone package use cases, not for every possible scenario: Add-on product (collective, plone, custom project, policy product)

Those goals have been originally outlined for bobtemplates.plone here: https://github.com/plone/bobtemplates.plone/issues/29


Features
--------

Package created with ``bobtemplates.kitconcept`` use the current best-practices when creating an add-on.

Buildout
    The package is contained in a buildout that allows you to build Plone with the new package installed for testing-purposes.

Tests
    The package comes with a test setup and some `tests <http://docs.plone.org/external/plone.app.testing/docs/source/index.html>`_ for installing the package. It also contains a `robot-test <http://docs.plone.org/external/plone.app.robotframework/docs/source/index.html>`_ that tests logging in. The buildout also contains a config to allow testing the package on `travis <http://travis-ci.org/>`_ that sends `notifications <http://about.travis-ci.org/docs/user/notifications>`_ by email to the package author.

Profile
    The package contains a `Generic Setup Profile <http://docs.plone.org/develop/addons/components/genericsetup.html>`_ that installs a browserlayer. For Plone 5 it also contains a uninstall-profile.

Locales
    The package registers a directory for locales.

Template-Overrides
    The package registers the folder ``browser/overrides`` as a directory where you can drop template-overrides using `z3c.jbot <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/z3c.jbot>`_.

Setuphandler
    The package contains a `setuphandlers.py <http://docs.plone.org/develop/addons/components/genericsetup.html?highlight=setuphandler#custom-installer-code-setuphandlers-py>`_ where you can add code that is executed on installing the package. For Plone 5 there is also a method in `setuphandler.py` that is run on uninstalling.

The package-types `Dexterity` and `Theme` add the following to `Basic`:

Dexterity
    Adds a simple content-type (you get asked about its name) in ``profiles/default/types/`` with a python-schema in ``interfaces.py``.

Theme
    Adds a simple bootstrap-based Diazo theme in the folder ``theme/`` and registers it in ``profiles/default/theme.xml``


Compatibility
=============

Add-ons created with ``bobtemplates.kitconcept`` are tested to work in Plone 4.3.x and Plone 5.
They should also work with older versions but that was not tested.
It should work on Linux, Mac and Windows.


Installation
------------

Use in a buildout
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    [buildout]
    parts += mrbob

    [mrbob]
    recipe = zc.recipe.egg
    eggs =
        mr.bob
        bobtemplates.kitconcept


This creates a mrbob-executable in your bin-directory.
Call it from the ``src``-directory of your Plone project like this.::

    $ ../bin/mrbob -O collective.foo bobtemplates:plone_addon


Installation in a virtualenv
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can also install ``bobtemplates.kitconcept`` in a virtualenv.::

    $ pip install bobtemplates.kitconcept

With ``pip 6.0`` or newer ``mr.bob`` will automatically be installed as a dependency. If you still use a older version of pip you need install ``mr.bob`` before ``bobtemplates.kitconcept``.::

    $ pip install mr.bob

Now you can use it like this::

    $ mrbob -O collective.foo bobtemplates:plone_addon

See `the documentation of mr.bob <http://mrbob.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_  for further information.
