# Hulu Subs Downloader | [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Xonshiz/Hulu-Subs-Downloader.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Xonshiz/Hulu-Subs-Downloader) | [![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/xonshiz/Hulu-Subs-Downloader.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/xonshiz/Hulu-Subs-Downloader/releases/latest) | [![Github All Releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/xonshiz/Hulu-Subs-Downloader/total.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/xonshiz/Hulu-Subs-Downloader/releases)
Little Python Script to download subtitles from hulu. Made for educational purposes (yeah,right).

Note : Hulu won't let logged out users to access the "Links" to single episodes. This caused the batch subs ripper to be shut down.
This will definitely take a shit load amount of time to fix. I'll have to figure out a workaround for this.

Watch How to use this : https://youtu.be/Ymrh99SUpUQ

# Windows Binary (.EXE FILE)
Move over to the [`release section`](https://github.com/Xonshiz/Hulu-Subs-Downloader/releases) to download the latest windows binary (.exe file). The exe is 32 bit binary file, which should run on both the windows platform (x86 and x64).

# First Things First!

Download the "requirements.txt" in some directory. Open Command Prompt and browse to the directory where you downloaded your requiremenets.txt file and run this command :

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

NOTE : You need to have "PIP" installed in your system and set in the path. Python 2.7.10 should already have this done. Just double check on your end though.


# What do I need to run this thing?

1.) Python 3

Note : I'm working on making this script available for both, Python 2 and Python 3. It'll take some time. So, have patience.

# How do I do what I have to do? (Simple Guide)
Watch this video if you can't get what I wrote below : https://youtu.be/Ymrh99SUpUQ

1.) Run "HuluSubsDownloader.py" File. (Run within CMD if you want to see the errors,if any).

2.) Paste the video Link when it asks . For Ex :- http://www.hulu.com/watch/815743 (Single Episode) and http://www.hulu.com/oh-my-ghostess (to download Subs for whole series)

Note :- Remove all the special characters from the URL,if any. Sometimes there are certain special values like "#0#1#78" etc.

3.) After entering the url, press 'ENTER' and sit back while it Downloads the Subs.

4.) Check this folder and you'll see your "SRT" ~~"vtt"~~ Subtitles.

# Known Issues

~~1.) No error pops up when there are no subs for a series/episode.~~

~~2.) Script is slow for "Batch Downloading", because of "PhantomJS" is being used to fetch the OuterHTML of the page.~~


# Changelog

1.) Geo Restriction is no more active.

2.) Some Major Bug Fix. (Now, videos with special characters in the title can be ripped, only subs are ripped, and not videos.)

~~3.) Added Vtt2SRT.exe for easy conversion of VTT subs to SRT. (Thanx Luiz for sending the link to EXE)~~

3.) Removed Vtt2SRT (No more needed).
