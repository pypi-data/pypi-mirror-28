        Generate a square 2-d matrix with an outward-spiraling series of elements
        -------------------------------------------------------------------------
        
        A matrix in the context of this code module is a python list whose
        elements are made up of a number of other lists which are uniform
        in terms of their element count. This list-of-lists structure thus
        forms a two-dimensional grid, a matrix, filled with individual cells.

           5x5 spiral matrix
        
        A spiral matrix is a particular type of squared-shaped matrix where
        each cell is populated with one value from a series of elements. The
        'spiral' in 'spiral matrix' refers to the condition that each cell is
        progressively populated with a value from the series following a
        pattern that conforms to a tightly-wound spiral. This spiral
        progression begins from the center cell, moving outward. Ultimately,
        the entire matrix is populated with elements from the series.

        The remainder of this document details the practical application of
        executing spiral-matrix from the command-line. For an explanation of
        api usage when importing as a Python 3.x module, please `click here <https://github.com/zero2cx/spiral-matrix/blob/master/docs/SpiralMatrix.rst>`__.
        
        Required parameter
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        ::
        
            DIMENSION
                This parameter is an integer value, and is limited
                to odd numbers only. This count of rows and columns
                constitute the constructed size of the the square-
                shaped 2-d matrix. (REQUIRED)
        
        General-purpose options
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        Column and row axis-labels along the top- and left-side can be
        prefixed to the printed output. Proceeding outward from the center
        cell in one compass direction or bearing, i.e East, North, West, or
        South, initiates the progression of the spiral. The spiral can be
        configured to progress in either a clockwise or counter-clockwise
        manner.

        ::
        
            --axes
                This parameter-less option enables or disables the
                prefixing of column- and row-axes labels along the
                top- and left-side of the printed output.
                (default: False)
        
            --bearing EAST | NORTH | WEST | SOUTH
                This compass bearing (E, N, W, or S) specifies
                the direction that is used to proceed initially
                outward from the center of the matrix.
                (default: E)
        
            --right
                This parameter-less option generates a spiral
                which progresses in a clockwise manner. Not for use
                with 'left'. (default: not used)
        
            --left
                This parameter-less option generates a spiral
                which progresses in a counter-clockwise manner,
                which is the default behavior. Not for use with
                'right'. Included for completeness.
        
        Options for the default style of integer-populated matrix cells
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        The default style for the generated matrix consists of the series of
        integers that begin with '1' and then increments by '1' for each
        element of the series. Either of these integer values may be modified
        in order to change the generated matrixâ€™s cell contents. Any positive
        or negative integer, or zero, is acceptable to occupy the center cell
        that starts the spiral. The increment integer must be a positive or
        negative, non-zero integer.
        
        Use of the following options will modify the implementation of the
        default behavior.
        
        ::
        
            --center INTEGER
                This integer value is used to populate the center
                cell that begins the spiral. (default: 1)
        
            --step INTEGER
                This integer value is used to increment the next
                cell's value as the spiral progresses from cell to
                cell. (default: 1)
        
        Options for the alternative style of token-populated matrix cells
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        As an alternative to populating the cells with a series of
        incrementing integers, a string of whitespace-delimited text
        elements, or word tokens, can be supplied. This string of tokens
        might consist of any combination of words, numbers, punctuation,
        or whitespace. The token string can be read from a file or stdin,
        or provided via command-line parameter.

           5x5 with axes, bearing: south, series: lorem_ipsum
        
        Use of either of the following options will replace the default
        behavior of populating the cells with a series of incrementing
        integers.
        
        ::
        
            --file FILENAME
                The specified file should contain some amount of
                whitespace-delimited text elements. The cells of
                the matrix are then populated using these elements.
                Usage of the 'words' option is excluded when using
                this option. (default: not used)
        
            --words [STRING]
                This string of whitespace-delimited text elements
                is used to populate the cells of the matrix. When
                this option is present with no string parameter
                given, then string is read from stdin. When
                utilizing stdin for string input, this option needs
                to be the last option provided on the command-line.
                Usage of the 'file' option is excluded when using
                this option. (default: not used)
