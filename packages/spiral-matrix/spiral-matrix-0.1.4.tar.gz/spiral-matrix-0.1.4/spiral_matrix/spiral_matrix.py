class SpiralMatrix():
    '''
    Generate a square 2-d matrix with an outward-spiraling series of elements.

    A spiral matrix is a particular type of squared-shaped matrix where
    each cell is populated with one value from a series of elements. The
    'spiral' in 'spiral matrix' refers to the condition that each cell is
    progressively populated with a value from the series following a
    pattern that conforms to a tightly-wound spiral. This spiral
    progression begins from the center cell, moving outward. Ultimately,
    the entire matrix is populated with elements from the series.

    Column and row axis-labels along the top- and left-side can be
    prefixed to the printed output. Proceeding outward from the center
    cell in one compass direction or bearing, i.e East, North, West, or
    South, initiates the progression of the spiral. The spiral can be
    configured to progress in either a clockwise or counter-clockwise
    manner.

    The default style for the generated matrix consists of the series of
    integers that begin with '1' and then increments by '1' for each
    element of the series. Either of these integer values may be modified
    in order to change the generated matrixâ€™s cell contents. Any positive
    or negative integer, or zero, is acceptable to occupy the center cell
    that starts the spiral. The increment integer must be a positive or
    negative, non-zero integer.

    As an alternative to populating the cells with a series of
    incrementing integers, a string of whitespace-delimited text
    elements, or word tokens, can be supplied. This string of tokens
    might consist of any combination of words, numbers, punctuation,
    or whitespace. The token string can be read from a file or stdin,
    or provided via command-line parameter.
