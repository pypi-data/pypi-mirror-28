      monitoring plugins
    + 'watcher_delegate': used to monitor a watcher delegate, i.e. without publishing
      any info (version, feeds) to the blockchain. This will activate the 'missed',
      'network_connections', 'voted_in', 'wallet_state' and 'fork' monitoring plugins

    monitoring plugins any longer, it is added automatically in function of the node type
