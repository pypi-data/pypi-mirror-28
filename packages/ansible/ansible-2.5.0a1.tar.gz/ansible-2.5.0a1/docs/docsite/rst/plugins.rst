Plugins
=======

Plugins are pieces of code that augment Ansible's core functionality. Ansible uses a plugin architecture to enable a rich, flexible and expandible feature set.

Ansible ships with a number of handy plugins, and you can easily write your own.

This section covers the various types of plugins that are included with Ansible:
