# DO NOT PUT RECIPES HERE

Recipes here ARE NOT version specific and cannot be added and removed with pip / enaml-native-cli.

Thus they break all the time. To make a recipe create a repo for it and use the `p4a_recipe` entry_point.

This way you can install the exact version your app needs and create reproducible builds.
