    """A Figure object specifically for a Sequence coverage illustration.

    This figure will illustrate the coverage of sequences at each position
    in the provided alignment. It counts the frequency of sequences at which
    a residue is present and plots it.

    This figure can be particularly useful in cases where domain boundaries
    could be redefined. It is also useful in cases where only parts of your
    alignment are well covered, and thus trimming the alignment might produce
    much more accurate Evoluationary Covariance predictions.
