overview
--------

	Our program is a front end that incorporates the simulation and LDNe
	based population genetics functions provided by tiago antao's python program at
	https://github.com/tiagoantao/agestructurene.git, enhanced by multiple methods
	for population subsampling when performing ld-based ne and nb estimations from
	genepop file inputs.  further, we have added simulation functionality and subsampling
	methods and interfaces for ldne estimation, as well as  plotting interfaces to show
	estimate distributions and regression lines. 

	the program uses multi-processing to allow an arbitrary number of
	simultaneous simulation, ld-based nb and ne estimations, and plotting
	interfaces.  further, within simulations, it can run simulation replicates
	simultaneously, and, within ne or nb estimation sessions, it allows
	simultaneously running genepop-file population sections. 

	The core functionality for simulation is provided by the python simuPOP
	package (Peng, B. & Kimmel, M. simuPOP: a forward-time population genetics
	simulation environment. Bioinformatics 21, 3686–3687, 2005), and the LDNe
	estimation by version 2 of the LDNe program (Waples, R. S. & Do, C.  LDNe: a
	program for estimating effective population size from data on linkage
	disequilibrium. Molecular Ecology Resources 8, 753–756, 2008).

current compatible python versions
----------------------------------
	python 3.5 and 3.6.  on Windows 64-bit platforms, we strongly recommend using
	the anaconda 3 python distribution, as it's "conda" installer supplies a
	pre-compiled version of simupop, which is often difficult to install on windows, 
	when you try to install through pip and setuptools (see item 2. in the dependancies
	section below).

	python 2.7 (python 3 is recommended, as 2.7 requires building an older version of simupop)

	the above are the python versions on which the program was developed
	and tested.  other versions may work, too.

os-comaptibility
-----------------
	1. linux. the program has been run on linux (ubuntu 16.04).

	2. os x. the program has been run successfully on os x, but the most
	   recent versions have not been tested on that platform.

	3. windows 10 and 8.1 (64-bit).  earlier versions of the program
	   were also run successfully on 32-bit windows 7 and vista, and
	   we consider it likely that it will still run well on those older
	   windows platforms.  note that on windows, a persistent problem 
	   is the inability of the program to remove files for
	   some cleanup operations when processes do not finish (through error or
	   user-cancellation). see the "bugs" file for this and other issues.

dependencies
------------
	The following are the python packages on which our program depends.
	aside from the installation of simupop, dependancies are automatically
	installed when you use one of the preferred installation methods listed in
	the installation section below.
	

	1. pip and setuptools, the python package installation modules, included
	   in most recent python distributions (see the installation section for
	   details).  All methods require the "pip" and "setuptools" python packages.  If
	   your distribution does not include them, please see
	   https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/.  

	2.  SimuPOP, a python package, hosted at
	    http://simupop.sourceforge.net.  See our instllation section below
	    for recommendations on aquiring this package. As we note below, the
	    easiest way to install simuPOP is through the 64-bit, Anaconda3 python3
	    distribution. See the installation section below.	
	
	3. Other python packages, which should be automatically installed when you use the pip 
	   installer, or the "setup.py install" command (see Installation, below), can also be installed
	   one at a time through pip with the command "pip
	   install <package>", or, if you use the Anaconda distribution of python,
	   "conda install <package>".
		
		i.   numpy	

		ii.  scipy
		
		iii. future

		iv.  psutil
		
		v.   for python 2 only, configparser.y. This is a backported python 3 package, different 
		     than the default python2 ConfigParser package. 

		vi.  for python2 only, if not already in your distribution, the ttk package.  The pip package
		     can be installed with pip install pyttk.

		vii. natsort

Installation  
------------

	A. Download the configuration files and manual.  The data branch of our
	   github repository supplies a collection of simulation configuration files that
	   will get you started in the program pipeline (see the manual for details on how
	   to load and edit the configuration files).

		1. Use the link to download the configuration files and
		   manual at https://github.com/popgengui/agestrucne/tree/data
		   You should find a green button on the right side of the
		   screen, and labeled, "Clone or download."
	
	B. Install the program
		1. Easiest install method, if you are using python3 on 64-bit Linux:

			i. From a terminal, type "pip3 install agestrucne".

			ii. Note:  according to the speed and RAM capacity of your computer,
				simupop can take many minutes to be compiled and installed.
		
		2. Easy and fastest, if you are using a 64-bit OS and an
		   Anaconda3 python installation, you can type (in the order
		   given) from a terminal:
			
			i. conda config --add channels conda-forge"

			ii. conda install simupop

			iii. pip install agestrucne

		3. Installation methods, in general.  These can be used, along with the
		   platform-based details directly following to match a method
		   with a platform/python combination.

			i. Single command method with pip:  
			   a. Open a terminal and type
			      "pip install agestrucne."

			ii. Single command method with setup.py:

				a. Download the program files  available at	
					https://github.com/popgengui/agestrucne/tree/master	
				   by clicking on the green button on the
				   right side of the screen labelled "clone or download"

				b. From a terminal whose current directory is
				   download's main  directory, "agestrucne"
				   which contains the "setup.py" file), type the
				   command "python setup.py install."

			iii. simuPOP installation followed by pip.

				a. Install simuPOP into your python distribution
				   following the instructions at
				   http://simupop.sourceforge.net/Main/Download.

					1. If you are using python3 from an Anaconda 3 installation,
					   you can install simuPOP quickly with these
					   commands at a terminal:
						conda config --add channels conda-forge
						conda install simupop

					2. Note If you are using python2, pip
					   will not install the correct version
					   of simupop.  Our solution, under
					   Ubuntu Linux 16.04, has been to
					   download the program files from 
					   https://github.com/BoPeng/simuPOP/tree/python2,
					   and use the "python setup.py install"
					   command from inside the simuPOP folder.  
					   After we installed a missing dependancy 
					   in our Linux installation, "sudo apt install swig", 
					   we were able to complete the installation. 

				b. Install the program and remaining dependancies with
				   "pip install agestrucne" 

			iv. simuPOP installation followed by setup.py.  This method is
			    the same as (iii), but, after you've installed simuPOP, then
			    use the method (ii) instructions to download the program
			    source and intall with the setup.py module.

		3.  Platform/python combination specifics. These refer to the
		    installation methods listed above.

			i. Linux, python3, with setuptools and pip3 installed.

				a. Use method (i) or (ii) above.		

			ii. Linux, python3, using the Anaconda3 distribution.

				a. Use any method, but note that simuPOP will be
				   installed much more quickly if you use method (iii),
				   and the "conda" commands noted above.

			iii. Linux python 2 any distribution.

				a. use method (iii). 

			iv. Windows, 64-bit, with python3 through an Anaconda3 installation.

				a. Use method (iii) or (iv).

			v.  Windows, 32-bit installations, or any Windows version using
			    python2.	

				a. Use method (iii) or (iv).

			vi. (Untested) OS X, python3, using the Anaconda3 distribution.

			    a. Use method (i) or (ii).

			vii. (Untested) OS X, any python3 or python2, using a non-Anaconda
			     distribution.

			    a. Use methods (iii) or (iv).
Starting the program
--------------------

	1. From a console, a terminal in Linux,  a DOS or Anaconda
	   prompt in Windows, you can start the program with the command,
	   "agestrucne."  The python pip installer should have added this
 	   command to your PATH variable in your user environment. 

		i.  Note that when you open the program, the current directory of your
		   terminal will determine where the file-loading dialog will be initially
		   set, as you locate, for example, a configuration file to load into
		   the simulation interface.
	
	2. In addition to "agestrucne,"  the installation should also add two
	   more commands to your user environment, which offer non-graphical
	   ways to run simulations and LDNe estimations. 

		i. Command "pgdrivesimulation.py" performs simulations from the
		   terminal, as specified in the user manual.

		ii. Command "pgdriveneestimator.py" performs LDNe estimations
		   from the terminal, as specified in the user manual.

Using the program	
-----------------

	To run a simulation, calculate Nb or Ne estimates, or plot results, load one
	of the three interfaces by clicking "New" on the main menu.

	For details about running the different interfaces, see the
	user manual.
