The Chaos Toolkit core library.

## Purpose

The purpose of this library is to provide the core of the Chaos Toolkit 
[model][concepts] and functions it needs to render its services.

[concepts]: http://chaostoolkit.org/overview/concepts/

## Features

The library performs the followings:

* validate a given experiment syntax
  The validation looks at various keys in the experiment and raises errors
  whenever something doesn't look right.
  As a nice addition, when a probe calls a Python function with arguments,
  it tries to validate the given argument list matches the signature of the
  function to apply.

* run probes and actions declared in an experiment
  It runs the steps in a experiment method sequentially, applying first steady
  probes, then actions and finally close probes.

  A journal, as a JSON payload, is return of the experiment run.

  The library supports running probes and actions defined as Python functions,
  from importable Python modules, processes and HTTP calls.

## Install

If you are user of the Chaos Toolkit, you probably do not need to install this
package yourself as it comes along with the [chaostoolkit cli][cli].

[cli]: https://github.com/chaostoolkit/chaostoolkit

However, should you wish to integrate this library in your own Python code,
please install it as usual:

```
$ pip install -U chaostoolkit-lib
```

## Contribute

Contributors to this project are welcome as this is an open-source effort that
seeks [discussions][join] and continuous improvement.

>From a code perspective, if you wish to contribute, you will need to run a 
Python 3.5+ environment. Then, fork this repository and submit a PR. The
project cares for code readability and checks the code style to match best
practices defined in [PEP8][pep8]. Please also make sure you provide tests
whenever you submit a PR so we keep the code reliable.
