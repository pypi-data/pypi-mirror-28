Odoo Medical Pathology
======================

This module extends Odoo Medical with functionality for pathologies (diseases).

Definitions
===========

* ``Pathology`` - The branch of medicine concerned with the study of the nature of
  disease and its causes, processes, development, and consequences.

Configuration
=============

The ``Disease`` configuration menu is in the ``Configuration`` section of the
``Medical`` app.

* ``Pathologies`` - Use this menu to add or view diseases in the system.
* ``Pathology Categories`` - Provides a hierarchical category structure for pathologies.
  These categories are typically standardized, such as ICD-10.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* The concepts here should be replaced with FHIR `Observation <https://www.hl7.org/fhir/observation.html>`_
  and `Condition <https://www.hl7.org/fhir/condition.html>`_ in v11. `More info
  <http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=Observation,_Condition,_Diagnosis,_Concern>`_.
* A concept of pathology aliases should be introduced, which will allow for pathologies
  of different code types to be referenced back to each other - allowing for code type
  conversions.

===========

Bugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues
<https://github.com/OCA/vertical-medical/issues>`_. In case of trouble, please
