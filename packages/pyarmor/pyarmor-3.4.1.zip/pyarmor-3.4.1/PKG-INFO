Description: Pyarmor
        =======
        
        Pyarmor is a command line tool used to import or run obfuscated python
        scripts. Only by a few extra files, pyarmor can run and imported
        obfuscated files in the normal python environments.
        
        Pyarmor just likes an enhancement which let python could run or import
        obfuscated files.
        
        Main Features
        -------------
        
        - Run obfuscated script or import obfuscated module
        - Expire obfuscated files
        - Bind obfuscated files to harddisk, mac address, ip address etc.
        
        Support Platforms
        -----------------
        
        - Python 2.5, 2.6, 2.7 and Python3
        
        - Prebuilt Platform: win32, win_amd64, linux_i386, linux_x86_64, darwin_x86_64
        
        - Embeded Platform: Raspberry Pi, Banana Pi, ts-4600
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Got source package from `pypi/pyarmor <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyarmor>`_
        
        Pyarmor is a command line tool, main script is pyarmor.py. After you
        got source package, unpack it to any path, then run paramor.py as
        common python script
        
            python pyarmor.py
        
        Basic Usage
        -----------
        
        The following examples show how to obfuscate a python package
        **pybench**, which locates in the **examples/pybench** in the source
        of pyarmor.
        
        Obfuscate package **pybench**::
        
            python pyarmor.py obfuscate --src examples/pybench --entry pybench.py \
                                        "*.py" "package/*.py"
        
            # Note that quotation mark is required for file patterns, otherwise
            # it will be expanded base on current path by shell.
            #
            # This command will create a extra file .pyarmor_capsule.zip in the
            # --src path, and save all the obfuscated scripts to default output
            # path "dist" in the current path
            #
            cd dist
        
            # Check obfuscated script
            cat pybench.py
        
            # Run obfuscated script
            python pybench.py
        
        Use project to manage obfuscated scripts::
        
            mkdir projects
            python pyarmor.py init --src examples/pybench --entry pybench.py \
                                   projects/pybench
        
            # This command will create 2 files: .pyarmor_config, .pyarmor_capsule.zip
            # in the project path "projects/pybench"
            cd projects/pybench
        
            # And there is a shell script "pyarmor" is created at the same time.
            # (In windows, the name is "pyarmor.bat")
            #
            # Now run "pyarmor" to obfuscated all the scripts by subcommand "build"
            #
            ./pyarmor build
        
            # Check obfuscated script
            cd dist
            cat pybench.py
        
            # Run obfuscated script
            python pybench.py
