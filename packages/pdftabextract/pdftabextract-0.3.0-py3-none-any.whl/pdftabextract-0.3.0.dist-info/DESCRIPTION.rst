This repository contains a set of tools written in Python 3 with the aim to extract tabular
data from scanned and OCR-processed documents available as PDF files. Before these files can be processed they need
to be converted to XML files in pdf2xml format using poppler utils. Further information and examples can be found
in the github repository.
