Description: pyRSD
        
        pyRSD is a Python package for computing the theoretical predictions of the
        redshift-space power spectrum of galaxies. The package also includes
        functionality for fitting data measurements and finding the optimal model
        parameters, using both MCMC and nonlinear optimization techniques.
