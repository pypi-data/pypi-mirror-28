# Wide Residual Networks in Keras
![Build Status][build-image]

A package of Wide Residual Networks for image recognition in Keras.

**keras-wrn** is **the** Keras package for Wide Residual Networks. It's fast *and* flexible.

Wide ResNets are faster to train and more accurate than traditional ResNets, even when pre-activation structure is used. 

## Quick example

```python
import keras

import keras_wrn

shape, classes = (32, 32, 3), 10

model = keras_wrn.build_model(shape, classes, 16, 4)

model.compile("adam", "categorical_crossentropy", ["accuracy"])

(x_train, y_train), (_, _) = keras.datasets.cifar10.load_data()

y_train = keras.utils.np_utils.to_categorical(training_y)

model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10)
```
