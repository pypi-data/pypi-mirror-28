Python library for analysing pixelated scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) datasets.
Pixelated STEM is using a 2D detector to image the convergent beam electron pattern generated by the electron beam after passing through a material.

The library has implemented several common functions used with these types of datasets, like radial integration and center of mass.
These are implemented as HyperSpy-type signals, where these new signals inherit various HyperSpy signal.


Installing
----------

The easiest way is grabbing the source, and installing using PIP:

$ pip3 install .


Using
-----

>>> import fpd_data_processing.api as fp
>>> import numpy as np
>>> s = fp.PixelatedSTEM(np.random.random(size=(5, 5, 10, 10)))
>>> s_r = s.radial_integration()
