Your Automated Cloud (YAC) - PREFS

Available comands include:

  yac prefs (-h | primer)

-h provides api help
primer will display this page

Private Registry:

Say want to use a private registry for your super-secret services instead of the public yac registry.

Simple, type:
>> yac prefs --registry

Yac will prompt you for the host and port of a Redis host of your choice

VPC Preferences:

Say you are a service provider and you would like to reuse a set of parameters that characterize your vpc.

Put the params in a file, then type
>> yac prefs --set=<path to vpc prefs file>

See https://yac-stacks.atlassian.net/wiki/display/YAC/VPC+Preferences for more info.

Say you want to share your vpc preferences with other members of your team or organization?

Using the same file, type
>> yac prefs --share=<path to vpc prefs file>

Say a buddy shared a vpc preferences description with the key 'awesome/prefs:1.0", and you want to leverage it?

First, find the exact vpc prefs key you buddy used:
>> yac prefs --list=awesome

Then set the prefs:
>> yac prefs --set=awesome/prefs:1.0
