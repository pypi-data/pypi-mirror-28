Naming refers to how yac names the resources it creates in your AWS VPC.

An example is a yac-created auto-scaling group.

The default naming convention for an ASG is as follows:

<app>-<suffix>-<env>-asg

Some naming control is provided by the vpc definition file, including:
* the delimitter used between the name parts, or
* casing word boundaries

See 'yac vpc -h' for more info on registering vpc definition file.

If you want complete control over your naming conventions, you can register a python file that implements your naming logic.

See 'yac naming -h' for more info on registering a naming file in the yac registry, and for configuring a yac client to use one of the registered files.
