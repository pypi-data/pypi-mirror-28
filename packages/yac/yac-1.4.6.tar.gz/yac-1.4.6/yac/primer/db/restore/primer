The db restore command is used to restore a DB snapshot into the RDS instance in your stack.

Restoring is useful for:
* disaster recovery, where the DB is lost and needs to be restored from backup, or
* demoting a production db to a lower environment (e.g. for upgrade testing)

The restore process can take awhile (~15 mins per 10 GB).
