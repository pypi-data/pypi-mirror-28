Description: # trkr
        
        `trkr` is a command-line tool to help track what our team is working on and
        how long they work on it. With Trello and Google Sheets integration, it allows
        you to search and select a related Trello card, and writes directly to a Worksheet.
        
        ## Requirements
        
        Python 2.6+ or 3+
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```python
        pip install trkr
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        Using trkr is as simple as running `trkr`. A list of valid command is available
        by running `trkr help`.
        
        ### Description
        
        Provide a description of the work accomplished. If none is provided, the commit
        message of the last commit at HEAD will be used.
        
        ### Hours Worked
        
        Time worked in hours (must be a valid number).
        
        ### Trello Card
        
        You have the choice to (i)nput a card's URL, fuzzy (s)earch for a card, (p)ick from
        a list of your assigned cards, or choose to (n)ot include a card.
        
        ### Date
        
        Enter a timestamp in the `MM/DD/YYYY` format. This can be skipped, and will instead
        use the current date.
        
        ## Setup
        
        To start the setup script, run `trkr setup`. It will ask for an email, Trello
        API keys, and the worksheet URL. All settings are saved at `~/.trkr/config.json`,
        and can be modified at a later time.
        
        ### Trello Authentication
        
        #### Finding Client ID and Board ID
        
        On Trello, navigate to a board and append `.json` to the URL. It should look
        something like `https://trello.com/c/<url>.json`. When the JSON data has loaded,
        hthe first `id` will be the *Board ID*; copy and save it somewhere.
        
        Search next for your name or username, find the `id` associated with it, and
        save it somewhere; this is your *Client ID*.
        
        #### API Keys and Token
        
        Trello API keys can be found at [trello.com/app-key](https://trello.com/app-key).
        The hash found under `Key` is your *API Key*, and the one under `Secret` is your
        *API Secret*. A Token can be generated by clicking `Token` on the same page; this
        is your *Token*.
        
        ### Google Sheets Authentication
        
        Once you've created a new Google Sheet, it's URL is the *Document URL*, and the
        name of the sheet at the bottom is the *Worksheet Name*.
        
        In order to authorize `trkr` to read/write from a worksheet, follow the steps
        layed out in [Authorizing pygsheets](https://pygsheets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/authorizing.html).
        With the JSON file in hand, move it to `~/.trkr/keyfile.json`. Lastly, share
        the worksheet with the email found in `keyfile.json`. `trkr` should now be setup
        and ready to use!
        
        ## Acknowledgement
        
        `trkr` relies on the great work done by the [pygsheets](https://github.com/nithinmurali/pygsheets/)
        and [py-trello](https://github.com/sarumont/py-trello) teams.
