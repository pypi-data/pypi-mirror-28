        # pyspark-deps
        WIP PySpark dependency management.
        
        ## Tests
        
        Running tests will modify your current virtualenv's packages. This software is WIP.
        
        ## Using
        
        Not in production, please! If you're curious to see how it can be used, check out https://github.com/nteract/coffee_boat/blob/master/Coffee%2BBoat%2BSample.ipynb
        
        This has been tested (although not thoroughly) with standalone mode and YARN. It explicitly does not currently support local mode, although we'd love your contribs.
        
        For now, stay tuned or join us in hacking!
        
        ## Alternatives
        
        Build you own conda env, or use one of the commercial integrated solutions which has a nice UI for this.
