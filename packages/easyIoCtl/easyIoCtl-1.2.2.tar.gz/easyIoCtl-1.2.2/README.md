# What is EasyIoCtl?
EasyIoCtl is a project designed to abstract away from boring IO operations in python, supporting asynchronous r/w operations.
IO can be performed against both hdd and memory.

# You can write to Memory?? Is this safe?
EasyIoCtl implements a number of memory controls to stop memory issues at the point of compilation.
Additional controls are patched into the source code to significantly increase the skill required to abritrarily control memory.
