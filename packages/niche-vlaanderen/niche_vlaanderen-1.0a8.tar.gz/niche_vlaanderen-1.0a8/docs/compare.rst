Comparing Niche models
######################

Apart from calculating Niche models, the ``niche_vlaanderen`` package also
contains methods for comparing two model runs.

This comparison is done using the ``NicheDelta`` class, which takes two
Niche classes as input. It is only possible to compare models after they have
been run.
