.. towncrier release notes start

4.0.0 (2018-01-17)
==================

Features
--------

- CHANGED BEHAVIOR! If an activated virtualenv is detected, it is used by
  default for ``devpi install`` and ``devpi use --set-cfg`` now.


Bug Fixes
---------

- devpi test: if basic auth is configured, correctly pass credentials when
  downloading packages and submitting JSON reports. Thanks to Vytautas Liuolia
  for the PR.


3.1.0 (2017-11-23)
==================

No significant changes.


3.1.0rc1 (2017-09-08)
=====================

Features
--------

- fix #386: add ``passwd`` command to enable password setting with interactive
  input.

- add ``-l/--list`` option to ``devpi test`` command to only list the release
  files which would be tested.

- add ``-s/--select`` option to ``devpi test``. This is a regular expression to
  select release files for which tests will be run. With this option it's
  possible to select wheels that aren't universal, or run tests only for one
  specific release file.


Bug Fixes
---------

- fix check for extracted path when testing packages where the package name
  contains a dash, but the extracted path has underscores.

- skip and warn about wheels which can't be tested instead of testing nothing.

- fix issue227: add ``logout`` command as alias for ``logoff``.


3.0.0 (2017-04-23)
==================

- add ``-r, --requirement`` option to `devpi install` to use requirements file.

- add ``--pip-set-trusted=[yes|no|auto]`` option to ``devpi use`` to add or
  remove ``trusted-host`` option to pip configuration when ``--set-cfg`` is
  also given. ``auto`` is the default and sets it for http servers and https
  which do not pass certificate validation.
  Thanks to Andrew Leech for the PR.

- add ``devpiclient_get_password`` hook which allows plugins to return a
  password based on username and server url.

- drop support for Python 2.6.

- drop support for devpi-server < 4.0.0.


2.7.0 (2016-10-14)
==================

- fix issue268: upload of docs with PEP440 version strings now works

- fix issue362: close requests session, so all sockets are closed on exit

- add ``--no-upload`` option to ``devpi test`` to skip upload of tox results
