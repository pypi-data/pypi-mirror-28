Description: python-cachelock: A simple look that uses the cache as acquirer
        ===============================================================
        
        The motivation: None! It's just for fun \ õ /
        
        How to install:
        ===============
        
            pip install cachelock
        
        How to use
        ==========
        
            You can use of two forms:
        
            - Use the `Lock` class to your blocks;
            - Or, use the decorator `once` to block your functions or tasks;
        
        With cachelock.Lock
        ===============
        
        Arguments:
        
            @cachelock.Lock(
                key=...
                cache=...,
            )
            ...
        
        You should use the Lock class as with context:
        
            with cachelock.Lock(key='foo'):
                ...your code ...
        
        If it is already locked, the LockError will be raised.
        
        With cachelock.once
        ===================
        
        Arguments:
        
            @cachelock.once(
                key=...
                cache=...,
                raises_if_lock=False
            )
            ...
        
        With the decorator, you can guarantee the unique execution of some function. It also allows you to configure your key according to the arguments of the function.
        
            @celery.task
            @cachelock.once(key='foo-{arg_a}-{arg_b}')
            def func(arg_a, arg_b):
                pass
        
        That way, if it is locked, the function quits silently. You can also ask `once` to raise `LockError`:
        
            @celery.task
            @cachelock.once(
                key='foo-{arg_a}-{arg_b}',
                raise_if_lock=True
            )
            def func(arg_a, arg_b):
                pass
        
        Integrate with Django
        =====================
        
        The cachelock checks whether django is installed, and if so, it uses django's own cache as aquirer. And if you wish, you can modify the default cache with `DEFAULT_CACHELOCK_ALIAS` configuration through django settings. The value must be an alias of some existing cache, by default it uses `default`
        
        
        *Remembering that by `default`, `cachelock` uses its own internal cache in memory if there is no integration with `django`.*
        
        Customizing your own cache
        ==========================
        
        To work it is necessary that the implementation of the cache has the `get`, `delete` and `set` methods. Ex.:
        
            class DummyCache:
        
                def set(self, key, value):
                    pass
        
                def get(self, key, default=None):
                    pass
        
                def delete(self, key):
                    pass
        
            cache = DummyCache()
