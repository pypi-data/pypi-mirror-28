        Serpent.AI - Game Agent Framework (Python)
        ==========================================
        
        Serpent.AI is a simple yet powerful, novel framework to assist
        developers in the creation of game agents. Turn ANY video game you own
        into a sandbox environment ripe for experimentation, all with familiar
        Python code. The framework’s *raison d’être* is first and foremost to
        provide a valuable tool for Machine Learning & AI research. It also
        turns out to be ridiculously fun to use as a hobbyist (and dangerously
        addictive; a fair warning)!
        
        The framework features a large assortment of supporting modules that
        provide solutions to commonly encountered scenarios when using video
        games as environments as well as CLI tools to accelerate development. It
        provides some useful conventions but is absolutely NOT opiniated about
        what you put in your agents: Want to use the latest, cutting-edge deep
        reinforcement learning algorithm? ALLOWED. Want to use computer vision
        techniques, image processing and trigonometry? ALLOWED. Want to randomly
        press the Left or Right buttons? *sigh* ALLOWED. To top it all off,
        Serpent.AI was designed to be entirely plugin-based (for both game
        support and game agents) so your experiments are actually portable and
        distributable to your peers and random strangers on the Internet.
        
        You’ll also be glad to hear that all 3 major OSes are supported: Linux,
        Windows & macOS.

        Background
        ----------
        
        The project was born out of admiration for / frustration with `OpenAI
        Universe <https://github.com/openai/universe>`__. The idea is perfect,
        let’s be honest, but some implementation details leave a lot to be
        desired. From these, the core tennets of the framework were established:
        
        1. Thou shall run natively. Thou shalt not use Docker containers or VNC
           servers.
        2. Thou shall allow a user to bring their own games. Thou shalt not wait
           for licensing deals and special game APIs.
        3. Thou shall encourage diverse and creative approaches. Thou shalt not
           only enable AI flavors of the month.

        Documentation
        -------------
        
        Guides, tutorials and videos are being produced and added to the `GitHub
        Wiki <https://github.com/SerpentAI/SerpentAI/wiki>`__. It currently is
        the official source of documentation.
        
        Getting Help
        ------------
        
        If you encounter a problem while using the Serpent.AI framework, you are
        encouraged to create a GitHub
        `issue <https://github.com/SerpentAI/SerpentAI/issues/new>`__. If you do
        so, please make sure to provide as much context as possible. You can
        also ask your questions and get help from the community on
        `Discord <https://discord.gg/9D5SuxH>`__ in the *#serpent-ai-help*
        public channel. Installation problems should also be directed towards
        that Discord channel and not GitHub issues; Your chances of receiving a
        prompt response are much better that way!
        
        Showcasing your Work
        --------------------
        
        Have you built something cool using Serpent.AI? Want to give the
        community progress updates? Share your repositories and videos in
        *#serpent-ai-showcase* on `Discord <https://discord.gg/9D5SuxH>`__.
        There is also a `wiki

        Serpent.AI is the love child of [@nbrochu](https://github.com/nbrochu)’s
        passion for science & experimentation, programming and video games. All
        of development and experiments can be seen live on the `Twitch
        Channel <https://www.twitch.tv/serpent_ai>`__.
