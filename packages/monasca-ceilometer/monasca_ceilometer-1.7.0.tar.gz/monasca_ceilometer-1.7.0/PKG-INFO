        ========
        
        Python plugin and storage driver for Ceilometer to send samples to monasca-api
        
        ### Installation instructions for setting up Ceilosca automatically
        
        See devstack/README.md
        
        ### Installation Instructions for setting up Ceilosca manually
        
        *To set up ceilosca automatically, read the instructions in devstack/README.md or use the included Vagrantfile*
        
        Assumes that an active monasca-api server is running.
        
        1.  Run devstack to get openstack installed.
        
        2.  Install python-monascaclient
        
              pip install python-monascaclient
        
        3.  Clone monasca-ceilometer from github.com.
        
              Copy the following files from *ceilosca/ceilometer* to devstack's ceilometer location typically at /opt/stack/ceilometer
        
                monasca_client.py
                storage/impl_monasca.py
                tests/* (skipping the init.py files)
                publisher/monasca_data_filter.py
                publisher/monclient.py
                ceilosca_mapping/*
        
        4.  Edit entry_points.txt
        
              Under [ceilometer.publisher] section add the following line:
        
                monasca = ceilometer.publisher.monclient:MonascaPublisher
        
              Under [ceilometer.metering.storage] section add the following line:
        
                monasca = ceilometer.storage.impl_monasca:Connection
        
        5.  Edit setup.cfg (used at the time of installation)
        
              Under 'ceilometer.publisher =' section add the following line:
        
              monasca = ceilometer.publisher.monclient:MonascaPublisher
        
              Under 'ceilometer.metering.storage =' section add the following line
        
              monasca = ceilometer.storage.impl_monasca:Connection
        
        6.  Configure /etc/ceilometer/pipeline.yaml to send the metrics to the monasca publisher.
            Use the included monasca-ceilometer/etc/ceilometer/pipeline.yaml file as an example.
        
        7.  Configure /etc/ceilometer/ceilometer.conf for setting up storage driver for ceilometer API. 
            Use the included monasca-ceilometer/etc/ceilometer/ceilometer.conf file as an example.
        
        8.  Copy the included monasca_field_definitions.yml and monasca_pipeline.yaml files from monasca-ceilometer/etc/ceilometer to /etc/ceilometer.
        
            This monasca_field_definitions.yaml file contains configuration how to treat each field in ceilometer sample object on per meter basis.
            The monasca_data_filter.py uses this file and only stores the fields that are specified in this config file.
        
        9.  Make sure the user specified under service_credentials in ceilometer.conf has *monasca_user role* added.
        
        ### Other info
        
        Since we don't have full repo of ceilometer, we setup the ceilometer repo in venv and copy monasca integration files in there,
        and run the unit tests over that code. At present this is tested against ceilometer stable/liberty branch, if you need to test
        against different branch you can change it in test-requirements.txt
        
        Relevant files are:
        monasca_test_setup.py - determines the ceilometer venv path and copies the relevant files over
        tox.ini - calls the commands for setup and runs the tests
        test-requirements.txt - contains the dependencies required for testing
