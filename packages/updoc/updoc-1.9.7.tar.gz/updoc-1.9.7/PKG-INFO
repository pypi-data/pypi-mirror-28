Description: Updoc
        =====
        
        UpDoc is a web application for uploading developer documentations, with a few interesting tips.
        
        Main features:
        
            * drag and drop archives of documentations (.zip or .tar.gz with a bunch of HTML files) to upload them,
            * RSS feed with the last uploaded docs,
            * RSS feed with the docs that you frequently check,
            * upload archives with a single cURL request,
            * generate RSS feeds with your bookmarks,
            * generate a proxy.PAC file.
        
        RSS feeds can be added as bookmarks folders in Firefox, so it is very easy to share sets of bookmarks in a company.
        Archives are fully indexed, so you can search any text inside all documentations, or inside a specific one.
