Description: ### University system integration
        In case you have no clue of what CLIP is then this package is not for you.
        
        There is a crawler to download every relevant public information out of CLIP in order to populate the bot database (and update it when needed).
        It requires student credentials.
        Even if you're a student and have the all mighty credentials, its probably not something you'll want to try.
        
        If you're brave and want to try it, or want that information for something else (please don't be evil), it takes several hours to bootstrap the database, and it's a somewhat error-prone process, which for the bot was done step-by-step, one entity at a time.
        Avoid doing so during times that might disturb other students access to CLIP. This thing does several requests every second. 1AM-6AM(GMT) it's probably your best shot.
