        Split VCF file into intelligible tab-delimited files.
        
        VCF stands for variants call format and is widelly used in
        bioinformatics for saving XX information for being flexible enough to
        store a wide range of data. Although it has been inspired by CSV files
        to (I suppose) make VCF easy to read by humans and easy to parse by
        machines, it is nowadays hardly doing well in both instances. It is a
        file format whose full specification cannot be given before-hand as each
        VCF files is free to specify the format of its own fields. As a result,
        the first step to process data contained in a VCF file is often
        extracting a subset of it and converting the extract data into a more
        amenable file format.
        
        This command-line Python package aims to tackle the above problems. It
        will split a VCF format into standard CSV files, each of which
        containing a different field of the original VCF file. Therefore
        facilitating making it both easier to read by humans and machines again.
        
        Install
        -------
        
        Assuming you have a up-to-date Python installation, you will almost
        certainly have all the necessary requirements to install unvcf. From
        terminal, enter:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            pip install unvcf
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        After the installation, you will have acccess to ``unvcf`` from
        terminal. In which case you can start using it as follows:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            unvcf path_to_file.vcf destination_folder/
        
        This will produce CSV files that represent the original fields of
        ``path_to_file.vcf``. For more information, you can enter
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            unvcf --help
        
        If by any change you face a problem or have a question, please, create a
        `new issue <https://github.com/horta/unvcf/issues/new>`__ and we will
        try to sort it out as soon as possible.
