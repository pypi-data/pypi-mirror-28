TDLib for Python
=================

TDLib (Telegram Database library) is a cross-platform library for building
`Telegram`_ clients. This wrapper is taken directly from the `official
example`_. The plan is to eventually bundle the TDLib binaries with it to make
it easier to install and use in Python apps.

If you want a more high-level Telegram API library, try `Pyrogram`_ or
`Telethon`_.
