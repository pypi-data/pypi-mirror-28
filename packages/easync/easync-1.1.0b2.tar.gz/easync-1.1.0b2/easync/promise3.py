    This is a threading wrapper that performs asynchronous call of the provided function.

    Basic usage:

    .. code-block:: python

        promise = Promise(func)(...__args)
        result = promise.wait()
        #  or

    For advanced usage, see https://developer.mozilla.org/ru/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise
    It is close to that document, though functions in Promises can use any arguments and should be started manually.
    Rejections thus are based on exceptions and resolutions are simply function results.
