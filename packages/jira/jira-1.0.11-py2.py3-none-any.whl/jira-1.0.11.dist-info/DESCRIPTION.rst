This library eases the use of the JIRA REST API from Python and it has been used in production for years.

As this is an open-source project that is community maintained, do not be surprised if some bugs or features are not implemented quickly enough. You are always welcomed to use BountySource_ to motivate others to help.

.. _BountySource: https://www.bountysource.com/teams/pycontribs/issues?tracker_ids=3650997


Quickstart
----------

Feeling impatient? I like your style.

.. code-block:: python

        from jira import JIRA

        jira = JIRA('https://jira.atlassian.com')

        issue = jira.issue('JRA-9')
        print issue.fields.project.key             # 'JRA'
        print issue.fields.issuetype.name          # 'New Feature'
        print issue.fields.reporter.displayName    # 'Mike Cannon-Brookes [Atlassian]'


Installation
------------

Download and install using ``pip install jira`` or ``easy_install jira``

You can also try ``pip install --user --upgrade jira`` which will install or
upgrade jira to your user directory. Or maybe you ARE using a virtualenv_
right?

By default only the basic library dependencies are installed, so if you want
to use the ``cli`` tool or other optional dependencies do perform a full
installation using ``pip install jira[opt,cli,testing]``

.. _virtualenv: http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/index.html


Usage
-----

See the documentation_ for full details.

.. _documentation: http://jira.readthedocs.org/en/latest/


Development
-----------

Development takes place on GitHub_, where the git-flow_ branch structure is used:

* ``master`` - contains the latest released code.
* ``develop`` - (default branch) is used for development of the next release.
* ``feature/XXX`` - feature branches are used for development of new features before they are merged to ``develop``.

* Minor fixes to jirashell issues #100, #102, and #66, and tweaks fix from d5856742771890ad18165197f6bc7eb3ff8cd086. The oauth\_dance and print\_tokens options specified in jirashell.ini configuration file are now correctly parsed as boolean values and OAuth with pre-authenticated access\_token and access\_token\_secret (skipping oauth\_dance) is fixed. OAuth options are now minimally validated for completeness, so #66 is fixed, allowing for basic\_auth without causing issue #102 as the merged commit d5856742771890ad18165197f6bc7eb3ff8cd086 did previously
* Fixed #88 so now groups are returned as a sorted list of strings
* Fix issue #100 - The problem is that 'oauth\_dance' should be an optional option argument, if it is not set, or if it is set to false, a valid use case still exists where OAuth should be used if the user supplies access\_token and access\_token\_secret through command line or configuration file options. This would be the case if the user had already authenticated externally with OAuth and had valid, authenticated tokens to pass to jirashell
