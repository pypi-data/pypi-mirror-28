**CyPy** is a `Cypher <https://neo4j.com/developer/cypher/>`_ resource library for Python.
It provides facilities for client-side graph data storage as well as tools for working with the Cypher language.
The library uses terminology consistent with `Neo4j <https://neo4j.com/>`_ (*nodes*, *relationships*, *labels*, *properties*, etc) and provides a convenient local model for remote Neo4j interactions.

See http://nige.tech/cypy for full documentation.
