Description: # Epyphany
        
        An in development network discovery service. Epyphany facilitates the broadcast of a discovery packet to the network so any number of clients running Epyphany can see it.
        
        ## Getting Started
        
        Epyphany supports python 3. To install it, simply run `pip install epyphany`.
        
        #### Step 1
        Initialize Epyphany using a port dedicated for discovery broadcasts. Here, we'll use `6000`.
        ```python
        from epyphany import Epyphany, Service
        
        epyphany = Epyphany(port=6000)
        ```
        
        #### Step 2
        Next, register a service. A service is generally hosted on a port that a client whom receives the broadcast can connect to. The port should not be the same as the discovery port. e.x. `6001`
        ```python
        class TestService(Service):
          def __init__(self):
            # ('test', 6001) = Service ID, Service port
            #   Service ID should be unique
            #   Service Port is the port that the received client should attempt to connect to
            super(TestService, self).__init__('test', 6001)
        
          def start_service(self):
            # Start up the socket for clients to connect to using "Service Port"
            pass
        
          def create_payload(self):
            # Any additional data the client may need to know
            return {'foo': 'bar'}
        
        # Register the service with Epyphany
        epyphany.register_service(MasterService)
        ```
        
        #### Step 3
        Then register a listener. This will be triggered every time it receives the broadcast packet. (By default, it would be approximately every 5 seconds)
        ```python
        @epyphany.register_listener('test')
        def on_discovery_test(protocol, service):
          print('%s: %s:%d' % (service.id, service.ip, service.port))
          print(service.payload)
        ```
