Wammu installation
==================

Packages for Linux
==================

Many distributions come with prebuilt Wammu binaries, if you can use them,
it is definitely the easiest thing. There are also binary packages of latest
release built for many distributions available on Wammu web site
<https://wammu.eu/download/wammu/>.


Building from Sources
=====================

It uses standard distutils, so:

    python setup.py build
    sudo python setup.py install

You need python-gammu and wxPython [1] (Unicode enabled build) installed to
run and install this program. If you want support for scanning Bluetooth
devices, you need PyBluez [2]. For incoming events notifications, you need
dbus-python [3].

For Windows you also have to install Pywin32 [4].

If you want to obey dependency checking at build time for any reason, you
can use --skip-deps option.

Cross compilation for Windows on Linux
======================================

You need Wine with installed all dependencies (see above section where to
get them).

Building installer for wammu for Python is easy:

    wine c:\\python25\\python setup.py build --skip-deps bdist_wininst

However this way user needs to also install all dependencies, what is really
not comfortable. This should be solved using py2exe [5]:

    wine c:\\python25\\python setup.py build --skip-deps py2exe

But except of this, you need to do a bit of manual tuning. To make py2exe
work in Wine, you need to fix it's binary using PE Tools (described in bug
report on Wine [w1]) and copy some extra libraries which are missing to dist
directory (python25.dll and libraries from wxPython). See script
admin/make-release which automates this copying.

Then you can use InnoSetup[6] to build installer for Wammu:

    wine c:\\Program\ Files\\Inno\ Setup\ 5/\\ISCC.exe wammu.iss
